can mean “right now”, or “during these current months”, etc.
b)

To express a habitual action, a general truth, or a statement which has no limitations
of time.

For logical reasons, the direct mode auxiliary (གི་འདུག) is used more often with the first and
the inferential one (གི་ཡོད་རེད།) with the second usage.
Adverbs of Time
Either the context will tell which of the two applies or there is an adverb of time, such as ནམ་
རྒྱན་ (usually) and སྦིར་བཏང་ (in general) or དྭ་ལྟ་ (now) which unmistakably indicates them.
There are also sentences where both interpretations are possible, for example when saying
དེང་སང་ (these days). The word xc"

(a lot, much, often), which is placed right before the

verb, is also a good indication for the habitual use of present tense.
Present Continuous
There is an alternative way to express present tense (mostly translated as present continuous)
which will be introduced in the box below — for your later reference.

Additional Information
As

explained earlier, present tense is used to either talk about a general truth or a

presently ongoing action.

Use བསྲད་ instead of ay
There is an alternative and very common way to express the latter. For example, instead
of asking:

ཁྱེད་རང་ད་ ལྟ་ག་རེ་བྱེད་ཀྱི་ཡོད། = What are you doing at the moment?
ཁྱེད་རང་ད་ལྟ་ག་ར བྱེད་བསྲད་ཡོད། What are you doing at the moment?

And your answer - following the logic - would be:
ང་ད་ལྟ་སློབ་སྦྱོང་བྱེད་བསྲད་ཡོད། = At the moment, I’m studying.

Profound Reason
The grammatical explanation of why we use a

which is a verb by itself, and why it

replaces the ny’, which is part of the auxiliary, is very sound and profound. But I’m afraid
now is not yet the moment for this to be revealed...
