1 — Lesson 7, June 2023

The first example expresses the general fact that the speaker does not know the way. It is
important to not perceive it as something intentional, even though the auxiliary pertains to

བདག
The second emphasizes that the not knowing is taking place right at the moment

of

speaking, or the speaker just realizes his/her not knowing.
3. Habit or Volition

ང་དགུན་ཁ་རྟག་པར་ན་གི་ཡོད།

ཡིན་ནའི་ད་ལྟ་ན་གི་མི་འདུག

I get sick every winter.

But now I’m not ill.

It is important to understand that the auxiliary here does not express intention but /abit,
something happening regularly. With བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག (non-volitional verbs) you use གི་འདུག if
the action is happening now, but གི་ཡོད། if it is habitual.
This is advanced philosophy and nothing to use actively currently — but important to know
in order not to be confused and misinterpret when hearing:

ང་མོ་ཊའི་ནང་ལ་སྱུག་པ་སྱུག་གི་ཡོད།
I (usually, normally) throw up in the car.
4. Habit or Direct Knowledge
The

fact that

sometimes

a habit

is also

experienced

by

the

speaker,

raises

another

interesting question: if I see somebody with my own eyes every day doing an action, why
wouldn't I say གི་འདུག?
ཁོང་ཉིན་མ་ རྟག་པར་སྐོར་ར་རྒྱག་གི་འདུག
(S)he does kora every day.
If it happens just once or a few times, you would indeed use the auxiliary གི་འདུག. But
whenever something is a habit or a general truth, one uses གི་ཡོད་རེད། ཿ
The above sentence is not incorrect, probably a bit unusual, but might be used if the
speaker also wants to emphasise her/his direct knowledge. The own experience would not at
all be expressed if s/he said:
ཁོང་ཉིན་མ་ རྟག་པར་སྐོར་ར་ རྒྱག་གི་ཡོད་རེད།
(S)he does kora every day.
But, generally speaking, the usage of གི་འདུག is more common for an action which is taking
place right now or to an action which the speaker has witnessed once or twice.
Remember the example in Lesson 2:
