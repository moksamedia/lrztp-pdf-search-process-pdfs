DID YOU KNOW THAT...?
དབྱར་རྩྭ་དགུན་འབུ།
In the Himalayas and on the Tibetan plateau,
there is a living being which is a sort of
grass in the summer (དབྱར་རྩྭ་) and turns
into a type of worm in the winter (དགུན་འབུ་).
This དབྱར་རྩྭ་དགུན་འབུ་ is considered a delicacy
and is also used for medicinal purposes.
It is particularly wanted and traded for good money
due to the fact that it increases man-power.
