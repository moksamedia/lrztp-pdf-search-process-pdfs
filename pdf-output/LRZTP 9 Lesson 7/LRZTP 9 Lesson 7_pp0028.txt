All the students came. (I've heard, I came to know.)
(Simple Past, Inferential)
An action was done without my witnessing it, but I can see its result with my own eyes:
སོབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སེབས་བཞག or: སོབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སེབས་འདུག
All the students have come. (I did not see them coming but I see them now.)
(Present Perfect, Direct)
I know that someone did something and want to express that I’ve heard about its result:
སོབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སེབས་ཡོད་རེད།
All the students have come. (I did not see them come, but I learned of it.)
(Present Perfect, Inferential)
I see that somebody is doing the action at the moment of speech:
སོབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སེབས་ཀི་འདུག
All the students are arriving. (I’m on the spot and see them arrive.)
(Present Tense, Direct)
I only know that somebody is doing the action now, or does it habitually:
སོབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སེབས་ཀི་ཡོད་རེད།
All the students arrive. (I’m not witnessing their arrival but know of it.)
(Present tense, Inferential)

Additional Note - For Later Reference:
The following two topics relate to the past tense. Because of the amount of new material
involved, they will be explained in detail in later lessons.
མོང་ is a secondary verb used to ask somebody whether (s)he has “ever done X.” (Lesson 12)
ཁེད་རང་བོད་ལ་འགྲོ་མོང་ངས། འགྲོ་མ་མོང་།
Have you ever been to Tibet?
No, I haven't.
The nominalizer རྒྱུ་ is used to express “not yet.” (Lesson 18)
ང་དེ་རིང་གི་ཚགས་པར་ལྟ་རྒྱུ་ཡིན།
I have not yet read today's newspaper.
