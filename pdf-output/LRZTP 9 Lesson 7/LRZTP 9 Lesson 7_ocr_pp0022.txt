1 — Lesson 7, June 2023

In the second last sentence, the position of ངའི་དགའ་རོགས་ཀྱིས་ next to the verb also adds to the

emphasis as we saw in Lesson 3.

THE

PRESENT PERFECT

Present perfect expresses an action completed in the past with an impact or bearing 11] the present
moment of speech. When deciding on whether to use simple past or present perfect, you cannot
rely on the English but rather need to understand the concept behind the Tibetan system.

Result
In Tibetan very strictly, present perfect is used to talk about only the resu/t of an action,
rather than the action itself. In many cases, the action has not been observed, but the result is

now visible and can be experienced by the speaker. It is a very common mistake of beginner
language students to not make that distinction clearly.

Snowfall Example
Maybe

the following example

can help you to understand what this tense is all about.

Imagine you are asleep, you wake up and look out of the window and it is completely white.
So, in English you would probably jump up out of joy and say:
“Oh! It snowed a lot!”
Translating this into Tibetan, you would then say:

ཨོ། གངས་མང་པོ་བབས་སོང་།
This is the classic mistake. Since you were sleeping, you did not see the snow fall. So,
you cannot use the auxiliary སོང་། as it expresses your direct knowledge. However, neither
should you say:

ཨོ། གངས་མང་པོ་བབས་པ་རེད།
This is not correct either as it would entail that one does not have any direct experience of
the snowfall whatsoever, and only have heard about it inferentially.
What they are actually talking about is the resu/t of last night’s snowfall — and this is exactly
what present perfect tense is for! So, the on/y correct sentence to say in this situation is:
