1 — Lesson 7, June 2023

The auxiliary ཡོད། literally means “I have” the food which I have made. This sounds very
different from saying:

ངས་ཁ་ལག་བཟོས ་པ་ཡིན།
I made food.

The latter sentence could mean that at any given time in the past, I made food, we ate it and
it is gone — which is completely different from the above sentence.

Absence of the Result — with Negation
Because ཡོད། means fo have / to be here, caution is required with certain verbs. Whereas it
might be correct to say “I have gone” in English, this does not necessarily apply to the
Tibetan. For example, the following structure would be rarely used:

ངྲ་ལབ་བཡ་ཛུན་ཡད།
oe

ལྔ

ལ་

ey

WY.

Much more commonly, one would just say:
Bran བྲ ལ ཕྱན པ ཡན།
Xs

v

¥

wy

wy

In Tibetan, one would not use the above auxiliary to say: / have gone. Why not? Because if I
left, I’m no longer present — the result of the action of going is not present.
The same applies for the verb “to eat” — whereas it is common to use present perfect in
English with the verb “‘to eat” — it is much less so in Tibetan. The classic question is:

ཁྱེད་རང་ཁ་ལག་བཟས་པ་ཡིན་པས།
Did you have food? Or: Have you eaten?
Rather than saying:

ཁྱེད་རང་ཁ་ལག་བཟས་ཡོད་པས།
This is because in Tibetan, present perfect is strictly used when we talk about the result of an
action — which in the case of the eaten food is no longer present.
It may apply when the result is actually important, such as:

ངས་སྨན་བཟས་ཡོད།
I have taken (lit. eaten) the medicine. (And I’m feeling better now as a result of it...)
However, still following the same logic, the negations do work. For example:
