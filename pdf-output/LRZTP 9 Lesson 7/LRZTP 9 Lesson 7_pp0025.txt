LRZTP 9 Module 1 – Lesson 7, June 2023
ང་རྒྱལ་ས་ལ་ཕིན་མེད།
I haven't gone to town. / I didn't go to town.
Maybe you have noticed in Lesson 6 that with the negation of པ་ཡིན། and པ་རེད། we (almost)
always use present perfect tense.
ངས་ལྟད་མོ་བལྟས་མེད།
I did not watch a movie.
ཁོང་གིས་རི་འཛེགས་ཡོད་མ་རེད། (S)he did not climb the mountain.

Direct Versus Inferential
Likewise, འདུག and ཡོད་རེད།, which express direct immediate experience and inferential
knowledge when used as “to be” or “to have,” carry the exact same meaning when used in
the Present Perfect:
ཁོང་སེབས་འདུག
(S)he has arrived.
This sentence unambiguously expresses: I have the direct experience of him having arrived.
Whereas, if I only know about a result of an action, I choose the inferential auxiliary:
ཁོང་ཚོ་ད་ལྟ་ཨ་རི་ལ་སེབས་ཡོད་མ་རེད།
They have not reached the U.S. (by) now.
Action or Result:
ཁོང་གིས་དེབ་ཡག་པོ་ཅིག་ཉོས་འདུག
(S)he has bought a good book (and I can see it here).
In this sentence, we cannot tell for sure whether the speaker has seen the act of buying or not.
It could be, but it is irrelevant. What the sentence is about is the result of the act of buying.
If they wanted to talk about the act of buying itself, (s)he would say:
ཁོང་གིས་དེབ་ཡག་པོ་ཅིག་ཉོས་སོང་།
(S)he bought a book (and I saw the action).
As mentioned above, since no such distinction of evidence is made in English, this takes a
little time to get used to. Remember that the second sentence would not be correct if you had
not seen the action happen!
