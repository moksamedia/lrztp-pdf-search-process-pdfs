Compatibility
The grammatical principles of Tibetan and English are not fully compatible. Very basic
sentences, such as “I have a book” (ང་ལ་དེབ་ཅིག་ཡོད།), have completely different structures in
Tibetan and English. In order to understand fully the grammar of the Tibetan language, it is
necessary to understand its grammatical principles on their own terms.
This textbook will use the Tibetan terms and categories as much as possible, but it will
also use grammatical terms derived from Latin where necessary.
Tibetan is an extremely situation-based language. For example, the difference between
direct (testimonial) and inferential knowledge is reflected in the choice of auxiliary that is used.
No such distinction is made in English. It is important to get used to this idea from the very
beginning. All the above principles can be understood from the example of the verb “to be.”
THE VERB TO BE
Unlike in English, the different usages of the verb “to be” (“somebody” or “somewhere”) are
expressed in Tibetan by two different modes of the verb. (This is similar to Spanish, with
“ser”, “estar” and “haber”.)
The first of these is described as “essential.” It expresses the inherent or unchanging
nature of something. For example:
ཁོང་བུ་རེད།

He is a boy.

The second usage is described as “existential.” It expresses that something is somewhere
at the moment of speech. For example:
ཁོང་བོད་ལ་ཡོད་རེད།

He is in Tibet.

When used with adjectives, the essential mode expresses the objective/inherent
aspect, whereas the existential form expresses a quality. For example:
ཁང་པ་འདི་དཀར་པོ་རེད།
ཁང་པ་འདི་སིང་རེ་པོ་འདུག or: ཡོད་རེད།

The house is white. (essential)
The house is beautiful. (existential)

Thus, the “essential” is used to describe the gender, nationality, profession, etc. of someone
or something whilst the “existential” is used to express a momentary place, state or quality.
