LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023

This is not a pen.
Extra grammar note
Even though these are the most frequently used combinations, it is not the case that ཡིན། and
མིན། are essentially linked to the first person and རེད། and མ་རེད། to the second and third
person. ཡིན། and མིན། are essentially linked to བདག and རེད། and མ་རེད། are associated with
གཞན་.

Now, what does this mean? If you are stating something about yourself which others

གཞན་ already know, you use the form linked to གཞན་: 1131]161\/ རེརད།. For example:

ང་

བོད་པ་

མ་རེད།

I

Tibetan

am not.

(As you know) I am not Tibetan.

ང་I

ཁྱེད་རང་ཚོའི་དགེ་རྒན་ རེད།

your teacher

(As you and everybody Knows)

|I am your teacher.

The same is the case when reporting something about yourself or talking about yourself in a
dream, movie, etc.
aN
Heer

ནང་ལ་

ང་

ed
རྒྱལ་པོ་

Nརེད།

dream

in

I

king

am.

In the dream, I was a king.
The opposite applies if you'd like to emphasize the personal relationship to yourself — བདག.
In this case y you use Gia} ན། when talking £ about someone else. For example:

རྒན་ལགས་སུ་རེད།
Who is the Teacher?
