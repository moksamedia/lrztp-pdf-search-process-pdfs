Objectives
1. You will learn to talk in simple sentences about your school, class, classmates,
teachers and Tibetan language learning experience.
2. You will identify the basis on which Tibetan and English grammar systems
fundamentally differ: particles versus verbs.
a) You will become aware of the all-pervasive notions of “self and other,” the
duality of “direct versus inferential knowledge” and how these concepts affect
the Tibetan way of thinking and talking.
b) You will be able to conceptualize and actively use “to be” and “to have,”
including their specifically Tibetan connotations.
c) You will learn of the existence of a more respectful language register and be
able to use a handful of most popular honorific words.
DID YOU KNOW THAT...?
དགེ་རྒན།
When you say དགེ་རྒན་(teacher), you are
actually saying “old virtuous one.”
དགེ་བ་ = virtue; རྒན་འཁོགས་ = old person.
