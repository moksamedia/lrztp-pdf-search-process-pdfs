LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023
Both of these are the འབེལ་ས་ connective particle. They have the same name, the same
function, the same use. It is just that, due to the different suffixes of the preceding word, the
spelling differs.

ཕྲད་རང་དབང་ཅན།
Independent particles
Likewise, the term independent expresses that the spelling of a particle does not vary
regardless of the (gender of the) suffix of the preceding word. For example:
བཀྲ་ཤིས་བོད་པ་མ་རེད། Tashi is not Tibetan.
སེན་པ་རྒྱ་གར་བ་མ་རེད། Penpa is not Indian.
Even though the suffixes of the words བོད་པ་ and རྒྱ་གར་བ་ are not the same, the spelling of the
དགག་ས་ negation particle remains the same. Bear in mind that particles (almost) always
follow the word they specify or belong to.
The first particle ཕྲད་ introduced in this lesson is the ལ་དོན་particle, ལ་. Its range of different
usages is extremely broad, but for the moment it is enough to understand the following:
 The ལ་དོན་ particle marks the place, aim, goal or recipient of an action or event.
 Whilst literary Tibetan makes use of seven different ལ་དོན་ particles, (སུ་, ར་, རུ་, ཏུ་,
ན་,ལ་, དུ་), in colloquial it is mostly the ལ་ or ར་ that are used.
Marking the place (locative function of the ལ་དོན་):
ཕྲུ་གུ་ སོབ་གྲྭ་
ལ་ ཡོད་རེད།
kid school
at
is.
The kid is at school.
The ལ་ in this sentence is specifying and clarifying the relationship between the two nouns
(the child and the school). The child is located at school. It is safe to say that the most
common translations of the ལ་དོན་are: “to”, “at”, “in”, “for”. It should be borne in mind,
however, that there are also many other occasions and translations for the ལ་དོན་.
Additional note – for grammar enthusiasts:
Grammatically speaking, the particles, such as ལ་དོན་, indicate which case is used for a
word or phrase. In terms of Latin grammar, the ལ་དོན་ marks the dative or object. Tibetan
