LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023

Extra grammar note
Also in the existential context, ARR can be placed to oneself, if the situation requires it.
For example, the speaker is not sure whether or not he has brought a pen and so searches
for it in his bag.
Depending on how the search ends, he will say:
ངཿ

ལ་

sy

འདུག

me

by

pen

__is/have

(I see), I have a pen.

or:

ང་

me

ལ་by

སྤུ་གུ་ _ མི་འདུག
དགོངས་དགSorry!
15 not/have not

pen

Sorry, I don't have a pen.
In terms of the translation into English, there is no distinction between ང་ལ་སྒྱ་གུ་ཡོད། and
ང་ལ་སྒྱུ་གུ་འདུག.

Both

mean

/ have a pen/pen.

However,

in Tibetan there

is a

strict

distinction between direct perception and inferential knowledge.
Thus, འདུག is used for direct experience, for something we have just discovered —
whether we are talking about ourselves or somebody else.
