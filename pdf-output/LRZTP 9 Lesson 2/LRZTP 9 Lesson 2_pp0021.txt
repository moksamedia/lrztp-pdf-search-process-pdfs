Extra grammar note
Just as with the essential mode, it is important to understand that ཡོད། and མེད། are essentially
linked to བདག. However, this should not lead to the conclusion that they are only used for the
first person. You can also use ཡོད། for others if you would like to emphasize some insider
knowledge or the relationship to yourself. For example:
ངའི་ ཕྲུ་གུ་ སོབ་གྲྭ་ ལ་ ཡོད།
My child school at
is.
My child is at school. (I have my child at school.)
The usage of ཡོད། emphasizes the strong relationship to the speaker, which in spoken Tibetan
is always related to བདག.
