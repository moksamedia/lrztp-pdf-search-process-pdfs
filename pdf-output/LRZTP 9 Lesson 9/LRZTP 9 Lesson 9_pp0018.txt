སྐུལ་ཚིག The Imperative
There are various ways to express the imperative in Tibetan. As mentioned in
Lesson 1, Colloquial Tibetan does not really have punctuation. So, you may
perceive some of the imperative markers below as an exclamation mark. And even
if there is no such marker in your Tibetan sentence, you need to put one in your
English one, as they are all imperatives.
a) One can simply put the present tense of the verb at the end of the sentence
without any auxiliary:
ཡི་གེ་བིས།
Write the letter!
And its negation:
རི་མོ་མ་བིས།
Don’t draw a picture! (lit. “write”)
Since it is clear from the context, in most cases, the pronoun (ཁེད་རང་, ཁོད་, or
ཁེད་རྣམ་ཚོ་) is omitted. Some people might suggest you to use it and say it is more
correct. But it seems that more often than not, it is clear who is addressed and the
pronoun is understood as being implied. The negation particle དགག་སྒྲ་ precedes the
verb and therefore comes towards the end and not in the beginning as in the English
sentence.
b) Some imperative forms are expressed by changing the vowel into a ན་རོ་ “o” as
with: ཟ་བ་ (“to eat”), ཉན་པ་ (“to listen”), ཉལ་པ་ (“to sleep”), ལ་བ་ (“to watch, to look
at”), etc. For example:
ཁ་ལག་ཟོ།
Eat (the) food!
