LRZTP 9 Module 2 — Lesson 10 — September 2023

Reported speech
As in English, the Tibetan language distinguishes between two types of reported speech —
direct and indirect (or hybrid). For example:
Direct: She told me: "You are a student."
This sentence is direct reported speech, as the words are repeated in exactly the way they
were spoken. In English this is signified by quotation marks.

Indirect: She told me that I was a student.
This is indirect reported speech, as the words are not repeated in exactly the way they were
spoken. In English this is often signified by the use of the word “that”.
In Tibetan, the distinction between direct and indirect reported speech only needs to be
made in certain cases. If the speech concerns the speaker or the person addressed, a distinction
is required. If the speech concerns a third person, no distinction is required. For example:
She said: "Lobsang is a good person."
She said that Lobsang was a good person.
Since this speech (i.e. what she said) refers to a third person and is neither about the speaker nor
about the person addressed, there is only one possible Tibetan translation for both of the above:

Direct reported speech
The formula:
Speaker

+ person addressed + &

+ quotation + Sx"

+ verb "to say"

For example:

ཨ་མས་ + YS

+ ལ་ + ང་ལམ་སེང་ཡོང་གི་ཡིན་ + ཟེར་ + གསུངས་སོང་།

The mother said to the children: "I will come immediately."
