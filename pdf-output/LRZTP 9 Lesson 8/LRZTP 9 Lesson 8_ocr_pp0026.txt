certain that the action will happen. Be aware that many Tibetans tend to pronounce the ཡག as

a UR". Whereasayaay emphasises the doer / agent of the action rather than the action itself.
So, one could think of “I'm a goer” as being a translation of ང་འགྲོ་མཁན་ཡིན།. It is safe to
say that, as a future auxiliary, མཁན་ is much less common than གི་ཡིན། and ཡག་ཡིན། And, since
མཁན་ has many additional functions as indicated in the table below, you should just know of
this usage of it passively at this stage. Please also note that a lot of Tibetans in exile do not
say མཁན་ but ཉན་ (no standardized spelling available), which means the same.

Additional Information for Later Reference:
It 1s important to understand that the use of ཡག་ཐཿ6 མཁན་ as future auxiliaries is only one of
their functions, and not the most common one.

Other Functions of ཡག་ and མཁན་

ཡག་ and མཁན་ are used as nominalizers.

A nominalizer is a syllable added to a verb

which converts the verb into a noun (Lesson 18).
