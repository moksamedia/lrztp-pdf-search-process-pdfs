The Humilific Language Register
Just for the

sake

of having

a complete

explanation

and to avoid

confusion,

“humilific” language register also needs to be mentioned here briefly.

the

so-called

Since there is only a

handful of words belonging to this, it is an even less important point to be concerned about at this
stage. But again, as it comes up in the simple question “what is your name?”

(when asked

properly), it deserves our attention here. Without going into more detailed rules, just be aware
that there are words which we use to make ourselves small and show respect. However, unlike ཞེ་
a, these words are therefore (often) used for ourselves. This book will use a minuscule (h) to
mark them. Three commonly used humilific words are:
ཞུ་བ་ = to be called, to say, to take

ཡུལ་བ་ = to give, offer
བཅར་པ་ = to go

For example:
ངས་ཁོང་ལ་ཐུགས་རྗེ་ཆེ་ ཞས་པ་ཡིན།
I said (h) “thank you!” to him.
