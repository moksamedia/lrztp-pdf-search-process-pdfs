Last but Not Least… (and for Later Reference)
The Humilific Language Register
Just for the sake of having a complete explanation and to avoid confusion, the so-called
“humilific” language register also needs to be mentioned here briefly. Since there is only a
handful of words belonging to this, it is an even less important point to be concerned about at this
stage. But again, as it comes up in the simple question “what is your name?” (when asked
properly), it deserves our attention here. Without going into more detailed rules, just be aware
that there are words which we use to make ourselves small and show respect. However, unlike ཞེ་
ས་, these words are therefore (often) used for ourselves. This book will use a minuscule (h) to
mark them. Three commonly used humilific words are:
ཞུ་བ་ = to be called, to say, to take
ཕུལ་བ་ = to give, offer
བཅར་བ་ = to go
For example:
ངས་ཁོང་ལ་ཐུགས་རེ་ཆེ་ཞུས་པ་ཡིན།
I said (h) “thank you!” to him.
ངས་རྒན་ལགས་ལ་ཕྱག་དེབ་གཅིག་ཕུལ་པ་ཡིན།
I offered (h) a book (H) to my teacher.
ང་རིན་པོ་ཆེའི་སྐུ་མདུན་ལ་བཅར་པ་ཡིན།
I went (h) in front of Rinpoche.

Speaking perfect ཞེ་ས་ might be a goal for a next course - or a next life. :-) But it is good to know
the most indispensable ཞེ་ས་ words and their most common usages. With the very short list below,
you will get quite far, promised!
1. ཕེབས་པ། = to come, to go (H)
ཁེད་རང་ག་པར་ཕེབས་ག = Where are you going? (H)
ག་ལེར་ཕེབས་རོགས་གནང་། = Bye bye! (H)
ནང་ལ་ཕེབས་རོགས་གནང་། = Please come inside! (H)
2. མཁེན་པ། = to know, to understand (H)
མཁེན་སོང་ངས། = Did (you) understand?
