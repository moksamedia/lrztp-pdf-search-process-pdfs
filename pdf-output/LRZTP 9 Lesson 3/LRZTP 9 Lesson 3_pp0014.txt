When the འདི་ precedes a noun, the translation emphasis is different again:
འདི་
སྨྱུ་གུ་
ནག་པོ་
རེད།
this [thing] pen
black
is
This [thing] is a/the black pen.
འདི་
ང་ཚོའི་
སོབ་ཁང་རེད།
This
our
classroom is.
This is our classroom.
འདི་
ངའི་
པར་ཆས་
རེད།
This [thing] my
camera
is.
This is my camera.
This needs a little getting used to because when we mentally translate a sentence from English
into Tibetan, we tend to start with the demonstrative pronoun since it precedes the noun in
English. For example:
“This book is good” We might tend to say *འདི་དེབ་ཡག་པོ་འདུག, which is an inaccurate
translation. What we actually need to say is: དེབ་འདི་ཡག་པོ་འདུག. Another version would be:
འདི་དེབ་ཡག་པོ་གཅིག་རེད། This (thing) is a good book.
Note
Do not get confused however when you hear people putting demonstrative pronouns before the
noun and still use འདུག in the end. So, some Tibetans would say:
ཟ་ཁང་ མ་གི་
ཡག་པོ་
འདུག
restaurant
down there
good is
The restaurant down there is good.
And others would say:
མ་གིའ་ི ཟ་ཁང་དེ་
ཡག་པོ་
འདུག
of down there
that restaurant good is
The restaurant down there is good. [lit. That (thing) down there is a good restaurant.]
It might even be the case that they are using the third use of ཕ་གི་ (explained below) leaving out or
not clearly pronouncing the ལ་དོན་.
མ་གིར་ ཟ་ཁང་
ཡག་པོ་གཅིག་
འདུག
Down there
restaurant
good
there is
There is a good restaurant down there.
