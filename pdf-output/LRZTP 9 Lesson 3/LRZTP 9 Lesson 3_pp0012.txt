THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS འདི་, དེ་, ཕ་གི་ + THE PLURAL MARKER ཚོ་
There are three main demonstrative pronouns which vary according to their relative distance from
the object they indicate:
འདི་ is equivalent to “this” and implies that the object is within reach and/or can be pointed at.
དེ་ refers to something further away. It is translated as “that.”
ཕ་གི་ is even further away. It means “(that) over there.”
Little less common, but still used, are ཡ་གི་– “up there”, and མ་གི་ – “down there.”
All of these can have the plural particle ཚོ་ added to the end of the pronoun. They are then
translated respectively as “these,” “those” and “those over there.”
In the case of ཕ་གི་, ཡ་གི་ and མ་གི་ however, it is more common to add དེ་ཚོ་ rather than only ཚོ་
So, they become: ཕ་གི་དེ་ཚོ་, ཡ་གི་དེ་ཚོ་ and མ་གི་དེ་ཚོ་. Some people also use the short version: ཕ་ཚོ་

the noun it belongs to. For example:
