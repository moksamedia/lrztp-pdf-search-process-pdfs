For Later Reference:
As will be illustrated in the following example, the position of the demonstrative pronoun
influences the meaning. So, depending on what one is trying to emphasize, the position changes:
སྨྱུ་གུ་ འདི་
ནག་པོ་
རེད།
pen this
black
is
This pen is black.
སྨྱུ་གུ་ ནག་པོ་
འདི་
རེད།
pen black
this
is
This is the black pen (among many.)
Further examples of the usual word order, which accordingly have no special emphasis of meaning:

“THIS [NOUN]”- USAGE
When it comes at the start of a sentence, འདི་ and དེ་ do not function as a demonstrative pronoun. In
this context, འདི་ means this [thing] and the verb at the end is mostly རེད།.

Some people also say སིང་རེ་མོ་ and argue it is more poetic.
