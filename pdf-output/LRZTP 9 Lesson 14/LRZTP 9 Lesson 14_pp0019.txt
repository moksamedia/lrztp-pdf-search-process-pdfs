LRZTP 9 Module 2 – Lesson 14, August 2023
meaning of both is the same, i.e. "because" or "after."
Some Tibetans say that ནས་ should never follow a negated verb. The argument is that
one cannot reasonably talk about "after" if the first action hasn't actually taken place.
Therefore, one wouldn’t say:* ངས་ཚིག་མ་སང་ནས་འཛིན་གྲྭ་ལ་མགོ་འཐོམ་སོང་། (I got confused
in class because I had not learnt the words.) Instead, these Tibetans would use ཙང་ or བས་.
However, it should be noted that not all Tibetans stick to this rule.
The connector ན་ཡང་ – “though”, “although”, “even though”, “despite”
Introduction
This connector carries a meaning that is the opposite of the one discussed above. Instead of
showing a reason, it shows a contradiction or opposite. It is nonetheless convenient to
introduce them both in the same lesson, since their position within the sentence and way to
connect to the verb and auxiliaries pertaining to བདག are the same. The conjugations of ན་
ཡང་ are the same as with only ན་.
Literal meaning
It may also help you to think in terms of "even if", "also if", etc, - since this is what ན་ཡང་
literally means.
ཡིན་ནའི་ is a short version of the expression ཡིན་ན་ཡང་, used in certain dialects. Their
meaning is exactly the same.
Two short sentences
Until now, you would have formed the following two short sentences, starting the second
one with "but" or "however":
ཁོང་བོད་པ་རེད། ཡིན་ནའི་བོད་ཇ་ལ་དགའ་པོ་ཡོད་མ་རེད། or: ཡིན་ན་ཡང་བོད་ཇ་ལ་...
She is (a) Tibetan. But she doesn't like Tibetan tea.
