སྒྲོལ་མ་ལ་པུ་གུ་ཅག་ཡོད་རེད། (specific and singular)
Dolma has a child.

There is no indication of either plural or singular, so one has to understand which applies from the
context. Therefore, if you want to be specific about one as opposed to many, you need to use ཤིག,
ཅིག or ཞིག which in Colloquial are mostly pronounced གཅིག.

There is a teacher at school.

ང་ ལ་ དེབ་ ཡག་པོ་ ཞིག་ཡོད།
me

at book good a is/have

I have a good book.
This ཞིག་ means “a” and indicates that there is (only) one.
The articles ཤིག: ཞིག and ཅིག are identical in meaning. They all derive from the word གཅིག (one).
The different spellings are related to the genders of the letters and are governed by the རྗེས་འཇུག
suffix of the preceding word.

In Colloquial,

it is common

to only use ཅིག regardless

of the

preceding suffix.
However, if you want to emphasize the number “1”, then you use གཅིག: which literally means
“one” and stress it with your voice to make a distinction between “a” and “one”.

ང་ ལ་ ཁྱི་ གཅིག་ཡོད།
me at dog one is/have
I have (only) one dog.

སྒོལ་མ་ ལ་ བུ་ གཅིག་འདུག
Dolma at boy one is/has
Dolma has (only) one boy.

མང་ཚིག PLURAL MARKER
On the other hand, if you would like to be explicit about a plural, you add & or དེ་ཚོ་. As seen
above, if you say the following sentence, we do not know whether it is one or many.
