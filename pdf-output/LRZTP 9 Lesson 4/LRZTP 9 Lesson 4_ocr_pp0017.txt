9 Module ] — Lesson 4, May 2023

There are also many stupas in Nepal.
This would be considered “unusual” word order by some and the simple answer to the question:
“Where are there many stupas?”’:

བོད་ ལ་ དགོན་པ་ མང་པོ་ ཡོད་རེད།
Tibet in monasteries many there are.
There are lots of monasteries in Tibet.
Again, this is either thought of “usual” word order or just answers the question: “ What is there
in Tibet?”

དགོན་པ་ མང་པོ་ བོད་ལ་ཡོད་རེད།
monasteries many Tibet in there are.
There are a lot of monasteries in 77bet (and not in some other place).
This is either seen as “unusual” word order or as the answer to the question: “ Where are there
many monasteries?”
བྲཀ་ཤིས་ སློབ་གྲྭ་ལ་ ཡོད་རེད།
Tashi

school at is

Tashi is at school.
Answer to: “ Where is Tashi?”

སློབ་གྲྭ་ལ་ བཀྲ་ཞིས་ཡོད་རེད།
school at 725/77 is
Tashi is at school (do not know about the others.)
Answer to: °° Who is at school?”

For Later Reference...
The issue becomes even more interesting when there are three parts of the sentence:

ངས་ མཆོད་རྟེན་ ལ་ སྨོན་ལམ་

མང་པོ་

བརྒྱབ་'རྒྱག་) གི་ཡོད།

I stupa

many

do/say

at prayers

(present aux.)

I say lots of prayers at the stupa.
“Usual” word order and:
Answer to the question: “ What do I do at the stupa?”

ངས་ སྨོན་ལམ་ མང་པོ་ མཆོད་རྟེན་

ལ་

བརྒྱབ་(རྒྱག་) གི་ཡོད།

I prayers

at

do/say

many

= stupa
