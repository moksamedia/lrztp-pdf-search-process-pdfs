LRZTP 9 Module 1 – Lesson 4, May 2023
If you erase the suffix ས་ from the three question particles, you are left with པ་, ག་ and ང་. These are
applied in the same way as the question particles, at the end of the sentence. The sentence is not then
an actual question but rather a statement with “isn't it?”, “right?” (or equivalent) added. For example:
དེ་རིང་ང་ཚོ་སིད་པོ་ བྱུང་ ང་།
Today we fun had (past tense) didn’t we?
(I think) it was fun, wasn't it?
སོབ་གྲྭ་ ལ་ དཔེ་ཆ་ འདུག་ག
school at pecha there are aren't there?
(I think) there are pechas at school, aren't there?
བོ་བཟང་ དགེ་རྒན་ རེད་པ།
Lobsang teacher is isn't he?
(I think) Lobsang is a teacher, isn't he?
ཁེད་རང་ རྒྱ་གར་ ནས་ ཡིན་པ།
you India from are aren't you?
(I think) you are from India, aren't you?
The particle པ་ and ག་ are also used to refer to oneself, but its meaning is somewhat different from
the above examples. We do not need to seek confirmation when talking about ourselves, so in this
context the particle could be translated by “as you know”, etc. For example:
ང་ བོད་པ་ རེད་པ།
I Tibetan am don't you know?
As I’m sure you know, I am Tibetan.
ང་ མི་ ཁད་མཚར་པོ་ རེད་མི་འདུག་ག
I person strange am not am I?
I’m not a strange person, am I? (You'd agree that I’m not a strange person, right?)
