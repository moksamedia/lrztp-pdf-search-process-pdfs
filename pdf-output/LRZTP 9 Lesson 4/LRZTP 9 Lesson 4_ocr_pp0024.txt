9 Module ] — Lesson 4, May 2023

ཡིན་ is not essentially linked with ༼༨" nor is རེད་ essentially linked with ཁྱེད་རང་. Instead, one needs
to bear in mind the function of the two auxiliaries.
aia, which is connected to aA

is used when revealing something that others do not know yet.

This not knowing yet is the reason why the question is being asked, and so ཡིན་ is used for the
person who is being addressed:

ཁྱེད་རང་ བློ་བཟང་ ཡིན་པས། ལགས་ཡིན།
You Lobsang are? Yes, I am (polite)
Are you Lobsang? Yes, | am.
རེད་ which pertains to གཞན་: is used for oneself when talking about something others might know.
When you ask a question about yourself, it implies that you don't know the answer. Otherwise you
would not ask. Therefore, y you use 25" དཱ་ for [¥ yourself when asking £ a question about yourself:

ང་སྩོན་པ་ རེད་པག།
I crazy is ?
Am I crazy?
ང་

ཨི་

ལེ་ལོ་དེ་འདྲས་ཅིག

རེད་པས།

མ་རེད་མ་རེད།

I

person

lazy suchas 3

am ?

No, no!

Am I such as a lazy person? — No, no!

Negation
The exact same rules apply when the verb is negated:
བྲོ་བཟང་ ལ་ པུ་གུ་'ཕུ་གུ་)ཡོད་མ་རེད་པས།
Lobsang to/by children not have/are not ?
Does Lobsang not have children?

ནང་ ལ་ ཁ་ལག་ མི་འདུག་གས།
house in food isn't there

?

Isn't there any food at home?
