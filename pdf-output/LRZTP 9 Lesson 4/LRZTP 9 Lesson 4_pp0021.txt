LRZTP 9 Module 1 – Lesson 4, May 2023
student(s) classroom in are
The student(s) is/are in the classroom.
To be explicit, you can add ཚོ་ and thereby exclude the option of there being only one.
སོབ་ཕྲུག་ཚོ་གིང་གའི་ནང་ལ་ ཡོད་མ་རེད།
students park in are not
The students are not in the park.
And often, people say དེ་ཚོ་ which can either be translated as “those” or just “the”.
སོབ་ཕྲུག་དེ་ཚོ་ ལ་ རང་སྦྱོང་ མང་པོ་ ཡོད་རེད།
the / those students by homework a lot there have
The / those students have a lot of homework.
“A” or “The”?
If the person or object has already been introduced, the definite article (“the”) is used for the
English translation. When you are speaking in general about any person or object, you use the
indefinite article (“a”) for the English translation. For example:
དགེ་རྒན་ སོབ་གྲྭ་ ལ་ ཡོད་རེད།
the teacher school at is
The teacher is at school.
The implication is that we are talking about a specific teacher. We could say, this is the answer to
the question: “Where is the teacher”.
སོབ་གྲྭ་ ལ་ དགེ་རྒན་ ཡོད་རེད།
school at teacher(s) there is/are
At school, there is a teacher. Or: At school, there are teachers.
This sentence is a general statement: we are not talking about any specific teacher. It is the answer
to the question: “What is there at school?” – There is/are teacher(s) at school.
ཡིག་ཚད་ དཀའ་ལས་ཁག་པོ་ ཡོད་མ་རེད།
exam difficult is not
The exam(s) is/are not difficult. (Talking about a specific one or two)
Answering the question: How is the exam? How are the exams?
