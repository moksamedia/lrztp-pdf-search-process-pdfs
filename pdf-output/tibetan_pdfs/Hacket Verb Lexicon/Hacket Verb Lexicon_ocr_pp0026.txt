LOCATIVE

ABSOLUTE

A locative-absolute construction is a complete or partial sentence that expresses
a condition in which something takes place or some type of accompanying
circumstance. It is one of the most common

syntactic structures for creating

complex sentences. The most common occurrence is with an expression of
absence formed with a negated verb or the existential verb of absence, 24.

While a reason clause often indicates a direct causal connection to what follows, a locative-absolute construction can convey similar generic information

in a less causal sense and merely indicate an accompanying circumstance or
condition. Although, as noted, this construction is seen most commonly in

negated form, it can also occur without negation. Such phrases still convey “a
condition or accompanying circumstance” but do so in a positive sense.
FUTURE

PARTICIPLES

AND

GERUNDIVES

The future participle expresses an action that is yet to be performed. In Tibetan,
the future participle is indicated by a verbal suffix, the future participle lexical
particle, ¥. For example,
ཏོན་མོངས་སྤོང་རྒྱུ་མེད་།
Afflictions to be abandoned do not exist.
or
There are no afflictions to be abandoned.

Another example of this construction can also be seen in a modifying clause
with the verbal collocation ལུང་སྟོན་:

འཇིག་རྟེན་ཞི་བའི་ལམ་ལ་འཇུག་པ་དང་། རབ་ཏུ་སྨིན་དང་ུང་སྟོན་རྒྱུཿཡི་གཟུགས། གང་ཡིན་དེ་
ཡང་འདིར་ནི་རག་གནས་ཏེ།
The bodies—by which worldly beings initially enter the path of
quiescence (i.e., nirvaXla),
[In the middle,] are ripened [in the Great Vehicle,] and [finally,]

are to be prophecized [in their enlightenment],
Always dwell in this [basic element of the truth body
(dharmadhatu)].
Once again, as with previously mentioned constructions, since here the lexical
particle ¥ is a homograph with the noun है (“cause”), attention must be paid to

contextual clues, especially when dealing with verse.
