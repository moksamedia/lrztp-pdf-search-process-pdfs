focus of this book will be verbs and verbal forms in relation to their requi-

site syntax and, secondarily, their role in and implications for establishing
boundary conditions in the task of semantic disambiguation.
As with most bilingual dictionaries, the purpose of this book is for it to be
used as a lexical aid in support of the activity of translation. This has been the
guiding principle in the selection of entries and example sentences: demon-

strating the use of the verb or verbal construction in context and specifically
in “real world” usage.
In general, there are remarkable degrees of alignment between the Tibetan
and English languages. The vast majority of Tibetan verbs and syntactic
structures can be mapped directly to their English-language counterparts.
Nonetheless, divergences between the expression of some concepts in both

languages do occur.’
Consequently, one can divide translation differences between two languages
into two categories: translation divergences, in which the same information is

conveyed in the source and target texts but the structures of the sentences are different, and translation mismatches, in which the information that is conveyed is
different in the source and target languages. Focusing on syntax in this context, a

sentence and its translation can diverge in a number of ways.’
Some examples of translation divergences between Tibetan and English are
as follows. For example, some Tibetan verbs—such

as 4\"|*—necessitate the

promotion of an English predicate adjective (in this case, “difficult”). Indeed,
many Tibetan verbs that express the qualities of their grammatical subjects are

realized as predicate adjectives in English.
Another type of translation divergence commonly seen is structural, in
which, for example, the verbal object in one language would be realized as a
noun phrase but in the other as a prepositional phrase. For example, with the
verb “ठग, the qualifier in Tibetan occurs in the second case (objective), but in

English it would be realized as an adverbial phrase with a preposition:

རྐུན་མ་སྒོར་ཕྱུང་།
Throwing a robber out the door.
(Literally:) Throwing a robber to the door.
Likewise, a number of these divergences occur with delexicalized verbs. The
construction XBA9°'F9" or ¥་ཀྱི་དབང་དུ་གྱུར་ is commonly seen. For example,
མཚན་ཉིད་དེ་རྣམས་མདོ་སྡེ་པའི་དབང་དུ་བྱས།

These definitions are made from the viewpoint of the Sutra
school.
