verb, the “base” verb 35“ is not—being a Class V verb taking its object in the
nominative case. Consequently, we must conclude that གཅེས་པར་ཟུངས་ is not a
verbal collocation but rather another instance of a verb, in this case 36" taking

a verb in the infinitive as a complement གཅེས་པར་, that verb having its own agent
and object phrases, པཌ་ཆེན་ཉིད་ and བརྡའ་ཆད་འདི་རྣམས་.
Far more challenging examples are seen in canonical works translated from
Sanskrit. For example, there is a passage in the Eight-Thousand-Line Perfection
of Wisdom

Sitra that reads བཅོམ་ཞིང་ཕྱིར་ཕྱོགས་པར་མི་འགྱུར།.

What is not immedi-

ately obvious is that the entire passage is a verb phrase; it is the Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit na bhagnaprsthibhavati (“to turn away disturbed”; “to be
dejected”). In this case, the translators broke apart the original Sanskrit verb
into the discrete lexemes bhagna (བཅོམ་) + prsthi (ཕྱིར་ཕྱོགས་) and na ... bhavati

(མི་འགྱུར་). As can be seen, the presence of a conjunctive particle (ཞིང་) does not
necessarily indicate a conjunction of two separate verbs. Rather, it is being used

simply to indicate that the resulting Tibetan words are to be taken together as
a whole—the phrasal equivalent of the underlying Sanskrit.
Just as tha dad verbs can appear in active and passive constructions, so too
can verbal collocations made with those same verbs. For example, the Class V
agentive-nominative verb འབྱིན་ (pt. 3%; f. དབྱུང་) can be translated as “to take

out” or “to send out” and has several collocations. A collocation used in a passive sentence can be seen with སྐད་སྙན་འབྱིན་:

མཐིང་རིལ་བུར་པ་དག་དང་ངད་པ་དང་།བཞད་སོགས་སྐད་རྷན་འབྱིན།
Blue-winged ducks, swans, and geese cry out.
Similarly, this can be seen with འྲ་བུ་འབྱིན་, here taking the adverb ཏོ་ག་པར་;
བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་ཀྱི་ལྔོན་ཤིང་རྟག་པར་ཡང་། འྲབས་བུ་འབྱིན་པ།

The tree of the mind of enlightenment perpetually bears fruit.
A number of other collocations in active-voice sentences—such as ར་བ་ཏུ་འབྱིན་ (“to
give ordination”) or སུན་འབྱིན་ (“to disbelieve” or “to corrupt”)—can also be seen.

Verbal collocations blur the issue of what constitutes a discrete unit of
meaning, or “morpheme” in Tibetan. In languages like English, a differentiation is made between free and bound morphemes—that is, between units of
meaning that can stand alone as words and those which function solely as con-

stituent parts. In Tibetan, certain elements of the language fall clearly into these
two categories, though some elements appear to function in different contexts

as either. In unsegmented languages like Tibetan, this latter group complicates
