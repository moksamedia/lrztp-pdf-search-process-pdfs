Verb Lexicon

[W]herever one treads, the ground still feels uncomfortably
shaky, especially in regard to the so-called verb; wherever he
gropes there is something that seems to ever elude him; and,
amid the weird philological phantoms that flit uncertainly
around in the prevailing gloom, his constant cry, I feel very

sure, is still one for more light.
â€” Herbert Hannah
