དེས་ཞིང་བྱར་སྣང་བར་བྱེད་ནུས།
One has the ability to illuminate those one hundred [buddha] fields.
In a passive construction, it conveys the sense of “to be perceived” or “to appear,’ as in:

ཇཛི་ལྟ་བ་ལ་གཟིགས་པའི་ངོར་ཀུན་རྫོབ་མི་སྣང་།
Conventionalities do not appear to the factor that perceives the
mode [of subsistence].
An extreme example of semantic differentiation can be seen in the case of
omitted verbs. A sentence that terminates without a verb typically implies an
omitted linking verb, such as ཡིན་. For example,

སྟང་པ་ཉིད་གཟུགས་སཾ།
Emptiness [is] form.
This structure can also be seen with a single noun phrase—a complement, with
a likewise implied anaphoric subject. That is the most common implication of
such an explicitly terminated phrase: an omitted generic verb of predication.
However, as the following example demonstrates, when a sentence terminates
without a verb, though contains an agent explicitly marked, the implied verb
omitted is བྱེད་ ("to make" or "to do"), a generic action verb. For example,

BAN ANS Say Aa G Amar ara ay AR
The designation [is made] with very suitable words.
Here, the differing syntactic frames—two noun phrases versus a noun phrase
and an agent—suffice to differentiate the omitted verbs ཡིན་ 3114 བྱེད་.

These and other such distinguishing examples are provided (where attested) for each verb in the Verb Lexicon section.
Verbal Forms

Gerunds, gerundives, participles, verbal agents, and the variety of other constructions involving verbs are all distinguished in Tibetan by their suffixed particles. These variations can be grouped together by their usage and semantic
implications.
