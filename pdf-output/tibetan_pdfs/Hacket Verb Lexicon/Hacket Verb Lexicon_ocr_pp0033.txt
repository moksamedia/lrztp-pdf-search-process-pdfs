N. COMBINATIONS OF AUXILIARIES
Finally, it should be noted that a number of combinations of auxiliaries are
possible. For example, the honorific passive imperative (verb + པར་གྱིས་) can be
combined with the future causative (verb + པར་བྱེ་) to form an honorific passive
future causative imperative (verb + པར་བྱ་བར་གྱིས་). Other such combinations, as
well, are possible: an emphatic reflexive causative with Class V and VI verbs
(verb + བྱེད་པར་འགྱུར་), an honorific reflexive causative imperative (verb + བར་གྱིས་
ཤག་), etc.
