pect, the use of the auxiliary verb Y* indicates the “imperfective” aspect. The
imperfective is used to indicate a verbal action that is repeated, habitual, or
otherwise occuring in the past and ongoing.

B. INDICATING THE PAST PERFECT
With verbs that have an inherently complete goal or semantic endpoint (“telic
verbs”), a past-tense verb when combined with the auxiliary verb ¥~ indicates

the “past-perfect” tense—that is, the completed action, for example, ཞིག (“to
dissolve”) and ཞིེག་པར་གྱུར། (“to have dissolved”).
Cc. FORMING THE SUBJUNCTIVE

The subjunctive mood is used to express a hypothetical situation, a situation
that is contrary to facts, or one that expresses a hope or wish. This is repre-

sented by an auxiliary construction with the form verb + པརའ་གྱུར་, Often seen
with the conditional marker 4, such a construction usually takes the form of

two sentences in which the first sentence (protasis) states the hypothetical situation in the subjunctive (“were X to be the case”), while the second (apodosis)
states the conditional resulting state or activity in the perfective aspect (“something would be ¥”). Simply stated, it is of the form # པར་གྱུར་ན་་་ ¥ པར་འགྱུར།.

4. PAST AND FUTURE CAUSATIVES
A. OPTATIVE / FUTURE / FUTURE CAUSATIVE (བྱ, བགྱི', ETC.)

The auxiliary construction verb + 03 is one way of conveying either the emphatic future (“[I] will do [something]”) or the optative mood (“[something]
should be done” or “[you] should do X”). It is typically formed with the future
tense of the main verb with 25३ ,
When the same construction is formed with the future-tense form of the
honorific action verb 5S’, the emphatic future becomes an emphatic future
causative, although specifically in the sense of the verbal activity being pro-

voked by an outside agent or event and (with Class V and VI verbs) often with
a reflexive sense.
B. PAST CAUSATIVE

Just as the verb གྱེད་ forms the causative construction, so too the past tense of
that same verb, གྱས་, forms the past causative (or emphatic). With a presenttense verb it forms the past causative (or emphatic), with a past-tense verb it

forms the past perfect causative (or emphatic), and with a future-tense verb it
