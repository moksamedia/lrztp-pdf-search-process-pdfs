PARTICIPLES

AND

VERBAL

NOUNS

The extent to which the Tibetan language bears the influence of Sanskrit cannot be overstated, and central to understanding this point is knowledge of the
role of the past passive participle in Sanskrit. A “past passive participle,’ simply
stated, is a derived form of a verb that expresses a past action in relation to an
object. It is often used as an adjective, but more importantly, in Sanskrit, it can
function in place of a verb. The same holds true in Tibetan.

Wilson describes this difference in usage in terms of “open” verbs (participles that indicate verbal activity within a sentence) and “final” verbs (verbs that
terminate sentences; cf. Wilson, 129-130); in Tibetan, the participle is formed
with the lexical suffix particles པ་ and \ (Wilson, 167ff). It is important to note

that the formation of a participle is identical to that of a verbal noun. In both
cases,
a verb receives the addition of a lexical suffix particle—either པ་ or
and its meaning is differentiated by verb tense or sometimes only context.

As one way of making an indirect statement, such a statement need not contain a referential noun (in English, such is rendered with a subordinate clause
introduced by the relative pronoun “that”). In Tibetan, these occur in the form
of a participle, such 38 གྱེད་པ་ with ཡིན་ or མིན་. For example,

ས་བཅུ་པ་ལ་ཡོངས་སྤྱོང་མེད་པ་མིན།
It is not that there are no thorough purifiers on the tenth
ground.
and with the inceptive form (see below) of the verb ཡིན་, AN |
དེ་ཚེ་ངེས་འབྱུང་སྐྱེས་པ་ལགས།

which can be rendered in English literally as “Then, [this] is [the start of] the
generation of renunciation” or more colloquially—making reference to the

past tense of the verb §'—as “Then, renunciation has been generated”
The use of the participle form of a verb often occurs in lieu of discrete
sentence forms—that is, in what would be considered a “run-on” sentence in
English. For example, stringing several participial phrases together—often
used as nominalized subjects in a list—gives rise to sentences like,
མེ་ཏོག་འབྲས་བུ་ཇི་སྙེད་ཡོད་པ་ད་ང་།

སྨན་གྱི་རྣམ་པ་གང་ད་ག་ཡོད་པ་ད་ང་།

འཇིག་

ཉེན་རིན་ཆེན་ཇི་སྟེད་ཡོད་པ་དང་། |
Whatever flowers and fruits exist, and any kinds of medicine
that exist, and precious things existing in the world, ...
