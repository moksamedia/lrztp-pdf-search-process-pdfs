INTRODUCTION
Monks, these two things conduce to the confusion and disappearance of the Dhamma. What two?
The wrong expression of the letter [of the text] and wrong
interpretation of the meaning of it. For if the letter be wrongly
expressed, the interpretation of the meaning is also wrong.
These two things conduce to the confusion and disappearance
of the Dhamma.

This section provides a brief overview of basic points of grammar, categories,
and concepts relevant to the study and mastery of the Tibetan language and
particularly to understanding the roles and functions of Tibetan verbs. In
the process, reference will made to terms and classical Latinate categories in
English (and Sanskrit) grammar. Although brief definitions of some more
obscure terms will be provided, it is assumed that the reader has at least a
working knowledge of these terms.
What this is not, however, is a theoretical description of Tibetan grammar—
either as historical/evolutionary speculation or as a prescriptive “ideal” form.
In this regard, the presentation that follows is fundamentally “descriptive” in
that it presents patterns of usage of Tibetan verbs and auxiliary constructions
along with qualitative descriptions of those patterns, making reference to

established categories in linguistic classification.

TRANSLATING

Grammar can be divided into two distinct, though related, areas of study:
morphology and syntax. Morphology concerns itself with how words are
formed out of smaller units (“morphemes”), while syntax is concerned with

the manner in which words are combined to form phrases and sentences.

Both of these can involve speculative research into diachronic linguistics
(that is, the evolution of the language over time), though given the premise of

the consistency and homogeneity of classical literary Tibetan, the domain of
this work is restricted to synchronic linguistic analysis (that is, the works in

the language viewed as a timeless coherent whole). In addition, the primary
