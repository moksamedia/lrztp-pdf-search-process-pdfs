In this example, the sentence is comprised of the generic action verb BF,

“to do” or “to make,’ in a passive construction along with two additional
elements: a nominative 01)]66[, མཚན་ཤིད་དེ་རྣམས་ (functioning as the passive
“subject” in this construction), and an adverbial qualifier, མདོ་སྡེ་པའི་དབང་དུ་.
Depending on context, the base portion of the [11738€ ད་བང་དུ་ connotes the

meaning of “through the force of

. ? “from the perspective of ...) or “to be/

come under the influence of ..” and takes a modifier prefixed to it with a
genitive connective particle (Wilson case 6.3). When mapped into English,
however, the adverbial phrase translates into an ablative (in this example),

instrumental, or prepositional phrase.
Another type of divergence seen in Tibetan is conflational. Conflation oc-

curs when certain semantically necessary arguments of a given action are incorporated into a single word in a different language. In Dorr’s example,’ the
single English word stab equates to the two Spanish words dar (give) and pufialadas (knife-wounds); that is, the two Spanish words are conflated into one

word in English. Algorithmically, a conflational divergence is characterized by
the suppression of a structural element (or conversely, the generation of one)
during translation.
In Tibetan-English contexts, this type of divergence is readily seen in domains where one of the two languages possesses a paucity of innate terminology resulting in phrasal neologisms being constructed. In the literature of Tibet,
this is reflected most clearly in Sanskritic compounds and in the technical vocabulary of states of mind. A simple example between Tibetan and English is
the verbal collocation ཡིད་ལ་གོམས་, often translated as “to meditate” although a

literal rendering would be “to familiarize within the mind”
Yet another divergence type is categorical. In such instances, a predicate
could be adjectival in one language—hungry in English—but nominal in the
other (hunger in German). In this divergence category, both the verb and

predicate mutually inform each other and both undergo transformation. In a
Tibetan-English context, there are several examples of structural divergences.
For example, an instance where a verbal object is realized as a noun phrase in
Tibetan but prepositionally in English can be seen in the example below with

the verb སོང:

Without having previously been [on] the Lesser Vehicle path ...
(Literally:) Without having previously become a Lesser Vehicle

path [consciousness] ...
