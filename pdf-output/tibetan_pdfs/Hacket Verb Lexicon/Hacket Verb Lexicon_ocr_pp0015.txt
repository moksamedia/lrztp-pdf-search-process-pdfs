The predominant variation in use of tha dad verbs—corresponding to
Classes V, VI, and VIII.2 verbs—is between the active and passive uses. The
active use of a verb centers around an action involving two participants, where

one—the agent—serves as the entity that brings about a change of state, and the
second is the entity that undergoes the change of state. The passive use of a verb

involves only a single participant—the one that changes state. Unmodified tha
mi dad verbs do not involve objects that undergo a change of state but rather
such changes occur to the subject, if at all. Sarat Chandra Das, for instance,
lists some semantic pairs which display these features. As an illustration of this
distinction, Das’s verb are reproduced with their associated Wilson categories
in table 1.
VERBAL COLLOCATIONS

Collocations, in general, are defined in terms of three attributes: noncompositionality, nonsubstitutability, and nonmodifiability. Noncompositionality
refers to a meaning which is completely different from the free combination
of words or which bears a connotation that is in excess of the sum of its parts.
Nonsubstitutability refers to the inability to produce a sensible phrase by sub-

stituting words for the components of a collocation. Finally, nonmodifiability
refers to the inability of a collocation to accept adjectival or pluralizing modifications of the whole or its parts. In a cross-language environment, such
phrases are readily identifiable as collocations by the first attribute, which
tends to result in a nonsensical reading when rendered literally into the target
language. In Tibetan, verbal collocations (or “phrasal verbs” as Wilson calls
them) are a set of verbs that are formed through the addition of one or more
adverbs or other modifiers; they adhere strongly to the first and second attributes, but only weakly to the third.

Verbal collocations, moreover, may or may not participate in the paradigmatic grammar of the root verb. In general, there are three types of Tibetan

verbal collocations:
¢
༠

verbal collocations that result from the use of an idiosyncratic adverb (such as ཙོག་པུར་སྡོད་ from £0’)
verbal collocations that arise from the verbalization of an object or
complement (such as ཡིད་ལ་གོམས་ from གོམས་)

༠

verbal collocations that arise out of the combination of two discrete verbs (such as འཁྱོག་བཤད་ from འཁྱོག་ and བཤད་, བཙན་སྤྱོད་་ from
བཙན་ and སྤྱོད་', or ཤི་འཕོས་ from ཤི་ and འཕོས་)
