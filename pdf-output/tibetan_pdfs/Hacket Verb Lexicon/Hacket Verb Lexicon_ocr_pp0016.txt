Collocations of the first type—with an idiosyncratic adverb—have two varieties: discrete and open. The discrete adverbial form is nonmodifiable and often
takes a Sanskritic or common adverb (see table 2). This is an instance of an
actual verbal collocation. The open form, however, takes a modifier marked

by the sixth “connective” case. This second variety forms the exception to the
nonmodifiability attribute of Tibetan verbal collocations. Technically speaking, open-form collocations are not collocations proper but are examples of
translation divergences (a subject discussed above). In this lexicon, these instances are merely treated as collocations for the sake of convenience and as an
aid to the student.
