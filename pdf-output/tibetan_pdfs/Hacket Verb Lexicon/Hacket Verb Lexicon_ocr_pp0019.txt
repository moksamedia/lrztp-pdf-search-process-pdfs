the recognition of grammatical structures. Moreover, there do not appear to
nats

be any hard and fast guidelines, ad hoc differentiation being the only apparent
approach. For example, two morphologically similar, though grammatically
different constructions involving the verb 35 can be seen. One construction,
ལག་ལེན་དུ་བྱེད་, is a collocation, while the other, ལེན་པར་བྱེད་, is simply an auxiliary

construction.
The issue of Sanskritic adverbs can further complicate the recognition
and translation of collocations. To illustrate, we can examine the adverbial

collocations formed from the root verb 9&4. In particular, the Sanskritic adverbs 535 and ཡང་དག་པར་ are used in different combinations to signify different Sanskrit compounds. In some cases, the prefixes translate fairly literally,

as given in table 2. For example, the adverb ཡང་དག་པར་, “completely, appears
with the verb འཇོག་ as:
དེ་དག་ཏུ་ཡང་སེམས་ཅན་རྣམས་བྱང་ཆུབ་ཏུ་ཡང་དག་པར་འཛོག་པར་བྱེད་དོ།

In these [world systems, bodhisattvas] completely establish sentient
beings in enlightenment.
However, this not always the case. For example, the verb phrase རབ་ཏུ་འཇོག་ is

used to translate the Sanskrit word prasthdpayati (pra-Vstha), which MonierWilliams identifies as meaning “to stand-up,’ or here, as “to set (forth),” as in:

མདོར་བསྟན་རབ་ཏུ་འཇོག་
Setting forth the teachings in brief...
While the combination of the two, ཡང་དག་པར་རབ་ཏུ་འཇོག, is used to translate the

Sanskrit word pradadhati or samyak-pradadhati, “to place” or “to set before,”
here, it translates as “to set,” as in:
ཞུམ་པའི་གཉེན་པོ་ཏིང་ངེ་འཛིན་གྱི་རྣམ་པ་བསྒོམ་པ་ནི།

གང་གི་ཚེ་ཡང་དག་པར་རབ་ཏུ་འཛོག་

Meditating in the aspect of a meditative stabilization that is an antidote to discouragement is “setting [the mind]” (the first mental
abiding (sems gnas)).

While such variations may be rendered nearly identically in English, it is possible, however, that subtle variations in meaning at a philosophical level are
connoted by such differences. Only commentary—oral or written—can sufficiently differentiate such constructions on a case-by-case basis.
