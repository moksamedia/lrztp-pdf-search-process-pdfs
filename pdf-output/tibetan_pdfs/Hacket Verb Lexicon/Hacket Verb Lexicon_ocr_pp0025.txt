with “9” For example, in Tsongkhapa’s Essence of Eloquence, there is a passage
illustrating these last two constructions with both utilizing different tenses of
the verb རྫོད་.. It reads:

རོག་པ་ལ་རྗོད་བྱེད་སྒྲ་སྤྱི་དང་བརྗོད་བྱ་དོན་སྤྱི་སྣང་བ་ནི་ཀུན་བརྟགས་ཀྱི་མིག
Appearances to a conceptual consciousness of sound-gener-

alities—which are the means of verbalization—and meaninggeneralities—which are the objects of verbalization—l[are] the
imputational eye.
In the above passage, both of these forms are clearly nouns. However, morphologically they are similar to the optative and causative verbal constructions,
especially when the latter occurs in verse. Consequently, careful attention must
be exercised when they are encountered.
GERUNDS

AND

OTHER

CONTINUATIVES

Similar to its function in Sanskrit—in which it is used to indicate an action performed by the same subject/agent of the main verb but temporally prior to the

activity of that main verb—the gerund construction in Tibetan is formed with
the non-case use of the fifth-case (the “originative” or “ablative” case) particles
to form a gerund or gerund phrase (also called an “ablative absolute”). It is one
of the most common syntactic structures for creating complex sentences. Such
phrases are typically translated into English by the use of the expression “hav-

ing been/done X ..”
‘The form of such phrases appears as “verb + ནས་” and thus is often easy to
recognize. It is also worth noting that the other fifth-case particle (ལས་) can
also be used to form a gerund, although such is typically found only in “Old

Tibetan” (pre-tenth century) writings and translations as well as in literature
that attempts to mimic it (i.e., intentional anachronisms). In addition, the use

of “" as a gerund marker carries a very specific connotation: that of thematic
disjunction—that is, its use indicates that what follows is somehow unexpected
or different in some aspect from the preceding activity. It can be translated as
“although having been ..”

Other than gerunds, the other common

indicator of continuation in

narrative text is the use of one of the rhetorical continuative particles: སྟེ', ཏེ་,

or 4’. A common usage of these particles is in the formation of a syllogism, in
which they remain untranslated; in other instances where they serve as sentence continuatives (as opposed to functioning as apposition markers in sastric

commentary), they are translated in a manner similar to gerunds.
