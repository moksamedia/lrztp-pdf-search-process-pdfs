in some Tibetan translations from Sanskrit the original “termination” is explicitly indicated through the use of auxiliary verbs, in particular the auxiliary
verbs 34) and འགྱུར་.

Consequently, we can begin with these two primary verbs used to form
auxiliary constructions: the verbs བྱེད་ and འགྱུར་ (and their tenses and alternate/

honorific forms). The modal implications that vary with context and the types
of verbs they accompany are as follows.

1. THE VERB བྱེད (HONORIFIC: མཛད

AND བཀྱིད་་)

A. CAUSATIVE CONSTRUCTION
The easiest application of the auxiliary verb བྱེད་ to understand is its use in form-

ing a causative construction. When occurring with Class II, 111, and IV verbs, the
auxiliary verb कै renders the causative form. For example, the verb འཇི་གས་ (Class
II) means “to be afraid,’ but the construction འཇིགས་པར་བྱེད་ means “to cause to be

afraid” and as a verbal phrase functions like a Class V verb (i.e., it takes an agent
marked in the third case together with a nominative object). In general, three
varieties of this construction occur: normative causative (verb + པར་བྱེད་; “to cause

to do/be X”), negated causative (verb + པར་མི་བྱེད་; “to not cause to do/be X”), and
causative with negated verb (neg. verb + པར་བྱེད་; “to maintain a state of not ×”).
13. REFLEXIVE-CAUSATIVE

CONSTRUCTION

When occurring with Class V and VI verbs, however, the auxiliary verb 34
(and བགྱིད་) produces a causative form that is reflexive in nature. This can be

contrasted with verbal phrases formed with Class V and VI verbs with the (explicitly) nonreflexive-causative verb འཇུག་ /བཅུག་ /གཞུགས་
/ཆུག་ (“to cause,” “to urge
on,’

“to entice”), which takes its verb in the simple infinitive.

Hence, for ex-

ample, one can find passages such as: དེ་ལ་གསོད་པར་བྱེད་པའམ། གསོད་དུ་བཅུག་པ་འགའ་

ཡང་མེད་དོ། “Thus, there is no one at all who causes [themselves] to be killed or
is caused to be killed,’ or in the case of a deontic causative (that is, a need that

is externally caused) a passage such as རིགས་གཞན་གྱི་ལག་ནས་ཟས་ཟ་ད་གོས་སུ་བཅུག་ཀྱང་*་
“However, [when external circumstances dictate that] it is necessary to eat food
from the hand of someone from another caste ...”
c. INDICATING SANSKRIT ACTIVE VOICE (PARASMAIPADA)

When occurring in texts or passages translated from Sanskrit, the auxiliary
verb 34 is used to explicitly indicate the active-voice (parasmaipada) termination rather than a causative construction. However, 1[ 3 reflexive pronoun is ex-

plicitly provided, then this construction can also indicate a reflexive causative.
