in the lexicon can contain multiple senses as well as associated collocated forms.
The structure of the Verb Lexicon part of the book is as follows. The primary
forms are first given (separated into homographs determined by syntactic class

and subdivided into senses determined by semantic range) with associated
equivalents and examples. These are followed by auxiliary constructions and,

finally, by collocated forms. Regarding the collocated forms, in addition to
verbal collocations formed with the standard set of Sanskritic adverbs, object-

dominated verbal collocations and translation divergences are also provided.
The Verb Tense Index part of the book provides an index to all base verb
tenses, referencing the present-tense form to be found alphabetically in the

Verb Lexicon section.
Citations to Sanskrit equivalents and sources of example sentences are
listed in a separate section just prior to the bibliography.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

As with the first edition of the dictionary, there were many who contributed
to the production of this second edition. First and foremost was Craig Preston

who, together with his students, offered very helpful feedback in the form of
numerous discussions concerning the scope and requisite grammar of obscure
verbs. Likewise, special thanks to Rebecca French for sharing her insights and
experience with Tibetan legal texts and their syntax. Thanks to Jason Dunbar
and Gordon Aston who provided me with numerous electronic texts, enabling
me to broaden my search of Tibetan literature for paradigmatic sentences for
verbs. Thanks to Nathan Hill, whose sophomoric assumptions about the first
edition encouraged me to be more precise in my description of Tibetan verbs.*

Similarly, thanks also to Bettina Zeissler, whose dissertation on Tibetan verbs—
by its demonstration of the levels of near functional illiteracy in the Tibetan
language that persist in some academic quarters—also prompted me to add
additional explanatory sections on Tibetan grammar to the introduction to
this book in order to clarify many points of grammar that some clearly find
difficult to comprehend.° Of course, thanks once again to Sidney Piburn and
the staff at Snow Lion, and now at Shambhala, Nikko Odiseos, Casey Kemp,

Lora Zorian, Liz Shaw, and Alex Catanese for their continued support, feedback, and guidance in bringing this second edition to print.
Finally, I should state that although this second edition has now been

published, the research underlying A Tibetan Verb Lexicon remains a workin-progress, and I continue to work on the linguistic database from which it

is derived. It is hoped that despite whatever deficiencies there may be in this
