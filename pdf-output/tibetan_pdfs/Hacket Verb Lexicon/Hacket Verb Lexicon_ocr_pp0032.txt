E. JUSSIVE
Likewise, the expression of a plea or encouragement of an activity is repre-

sented by the use of the verb 4 in an auxiliary construction.
F. DESIDERATIVE
Indication of desire and aspiration other than the precative (see above) is represented by the use of the verb སྨོན་ in the form: verb + པར་སྨོན་.

6. DEONTIC / PERMISSIVE
There are several ways of expressing the deontic mood (i.e., expressing neces-

आए) in Tibetan, although all are typically rendered in English as “need to,”
“have to,’ or “must; with or without additional emphatic adverbs. The permissive (or weak deontic) expresses the ideas of “to let” or “to allow. The simple
deontic is formed with the Class VII verb དགོས་ functioning as an auxiliary,
while the moderate deontic is formed with the verb མཆི་ and the permissive
with the verbs ཆུག་ and ཆོག་.

The strong/honorific deontic—in addition to the exhortative (described
above)—is formed in two ways. One way is to use the auxiliary verb འཚོལ་,
which also conveys a sense of future obligation. The other way is with བྱ་དགོས་.

11. EPISTEMIC
Borrowing a construction from colloquial Tibetan, a weak epistemic sense is
conveyed by the verb འདུ་ག་ used as an auxiliary verb. For example: དེ་འགྲེལ་པ་འདི་

ཡིན་འདུག “This seems to be that commentary” Although this same construction
can also simply indicate ongoing activity (see below).
Otherwise, certain epistemic senses are conveyed using the evidential verb
གྲུགས་ (“to be reputed to be”) and the conjectural verb &* (“to appear to be”).
1. CONTINUATIVE

Ongoing activity is represented in a number of ways: verb + པར་འདུ་ག་ or verb +
པར་གནས་, in the honorific as verb + པར་བཞུགས་, and in the high honorific as verb

+ པར་གདའ་.
J. INCEPTIVE
Indication of the beginning of an activity or a statement of something being
the case henceforth is represented by the use of the verb “"|“"’—a cognate with
the Apabhraméa auxiliary /ag(g)—in the form: verb + ལགས་, It is often used in
