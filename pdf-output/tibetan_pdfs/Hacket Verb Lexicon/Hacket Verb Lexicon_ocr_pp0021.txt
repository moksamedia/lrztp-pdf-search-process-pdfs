senses correlated with different sets of accompanying arguments. In its most
simple paradigmatic construction, the Class V verb 4" connotes the sense of
“to compose.” For example,
°,

°

However, in a different syntactic context—one involving only the presence of
an ablative (case 5) qualifier—the verb conveys the sense of “to stem (from)”
or “to be based (on)”:
ཆོས་རྣམས་ཀྱི་ངོ་བོ་ཉིད་མ་མཆིས་པ་ཉིད་ལས་བརྩམས་་

Based on just the naturelessness of all phenomena ...
In many instances there are also semantic variations that are close in scope
though differentiable by different syntactic frames. The verb སེམས་, for instance,
conveys the general sense of cognitive activity. In its usage, however, three distinct though related senses can be seen. In an active construction with a nominative object, it connotes the loose sense of “to think (about)”:
འཁོར་བའི་སྣག་བསྔལ་རྣམས་བསམ་་

Thinking about the sufferings of cyclic existence ...
However, with an object marked explicitly in the second case (“objective”), the

more specific meaning of “to meditate (on)” is indicated:
དམ་ཆོས་འདི་ལ་བསམ་གྱུར་*་

Meditating on this true teaching ...
Finally, in a construction with a verbal or sentential complement marked in

the second case (“objective”), the more specific meaning of “to think (that)” is
conveyed:
རྒྱལ་སྲས་ལག་ལེན་འཁྲུལ་མེད་ལགས་པར་སེམས།
I think that these practices of the Conqueror’s sons are without error.
Other variations in word sense occur as an artifact of active/passive alterna-

tions. For example, the Class III verb गैर conveys the sense of “to illuminate” in
an active construction, as in:
