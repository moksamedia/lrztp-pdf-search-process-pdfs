PREFACE

ABOUT

THE

SECOND

EDITION

It has been fifteen years since the publication of the first edition of A Tibetan
Verb Lexicon. As noted in that first edition, the information presented was

initially compiled as a resource lexicon recording the syntactic features of
Tibetan verbs for the purposes of natural language processing and computational linguistic analysis aimed at the automatic processing of Tibetan text.
Understandably, the scope of that first edition was limited by the resources

available to me at the time. Since then, numerous additional resources have
become available, enhancing and enabling research in Tibetan verbs. In addition to the growth of e-text archives (in both Tibetan and Sanskrit), the
publications of several Sanskrit texts by the scholars in Sarnath, Vienna, and

Beijing, as well as Negi’s voluminous Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionary (bod skad
dang legs sbyar gyi tshig mdzod chen mo, Varanasi 1993-2005) have greatly
enhanced the ability to consult the large body of extant Sanskrit canonical
literature for the purpose of determining the range of meanings and senses of

Tibetan verbs and verbal collocations.
Over the years I have received much positive feedback and constructive
suggestions from many people (and less-than-constructive criticism from a
few), all of which I have attempted to incorporate into this second edition.

While the first edition was limited to the subset of verbs that I had been able to
validate and locate example sentences for (less than one third of my complete
database at the time), this second edition is far more inclusive in scope, covering nearly all verbs attested in other lexical resources. It also covers all of the
verbs in the texts included in the author's recently published Tibetan language

reader, Learning Classical Tibetan: A Reader for Translating Buddhist Texts, as
well as some newly identified verbs not found in any other dictionaries. As
with the first edition, information related to the verbal classification scheme
derived from Joe Wilson's presentation of Tibetan grammar is included.’ A
major addition to this lexicon, however, is the inclusion of auxiliary verb constructions, identification of their modal ranges, and example sentences (many

with Sanskrit equivalents). A discussion of modal auxiliary verbs is included
in the introduction.
It bears explicit mention that this verb lexicon is self-consciously aimed
