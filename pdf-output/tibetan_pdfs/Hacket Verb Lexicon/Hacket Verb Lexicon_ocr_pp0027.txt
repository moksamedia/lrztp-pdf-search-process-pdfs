The other form of future participles is the gerundive. This is formed by
the nominalization of the optative construction (“one should do X”). Such instances take the form of verb + པར་བྱ་བ་ but are commonly abbreviated as verb +
2, “that which is to be done” or “object of verbal activity”

CLAUSE-CONNECTIVE

CONSTRUCTIONS

One of the most common syntactic structures for creating complex sentences
is the use of the sixth case (the “connective” or “genitive” case) to form a clauseconnective construction. In simplest terms, a clause-connective construction is

a way of modifying a noun adjectivally with a verbal phrase or clause. Wilson
provides a useful categorization of clause-connective expressions by identify-

ing the role that the noun that follows them would play were it to appear in
the clause that precedes it in a complete sentence. Wilson thus identified four
basic types: subject/agent, object, complement, and qualifier. An example of a
clause connective to an agent (and the fully formed sentence demonstrating
that identification) would be:
ཆོས་བསྟན་པའི་སངས་རྒྱས། => སངས་རྒྱས་ཀྱིས་ཆོས་བསྟན།

“The Buddha, who taught the Dharma” =>
“The Buddha taught the Dharma”
and so on.”

AUXILIARY

CONSTRUCTIONS

One of the least understood grammatical constructions in Tibetan is the set
of auxiliary constructions. The primary reason for this would appear to be the
contextual nature of their specific implications that, to my knowledge, have yet

to be fully and formally described. What is presented below is a first attempt
at categorizing and describing the specific contexts and uses of the different
auxiliary verb constructions. It should be taken as an attempt at a taxonomy of
auxiliary constructions.

Tibetan versus Sanskrit uses of Auxiliary Verbs
One of the primary distinctions that is necessary to recognize is the difference
in use of auxiliary constructions between native compositions and translated
Sanskrit. Sanskrit verbs, when conjugated, typically take one of two types of
endings referred to as active-voice (parasmaipada) terminations and middle-

voice (dtmanepada) terminations. Typically, Sanskrit verbs take one or the
other termination, while some can take either. The point of interest here is that
