The use of the auxiliary verb མཛད་་ likewise indicates an original Sanskrit

active-voice (parasmaipada) termination, although it is used specifically to indicate that a Sanskrit verb that typically takess a middle-voice (a4tmanepada)
termination has been rendered in an active-voice (parasmaipada) construction.

2, THE VERB AUN
A. INDICATING TRANSFORMATION
One use of the auxiliary verb 4%¥\—in its most literal sense—is to indicate
transformation: “becoming X” or “coming to be X” It occurs most often with
Class II verbs.

B. INDICATING THE PERFECTIVE
Another use of the auxiliary verb འགྱུར་ is to indicate the “perfective” aspect. In
general, the perfective is used to indicate the verbal action being viewed as a
whole or in the abstract sense. It is seen commonly in statements that refer to
a future event in an abstract or hypothetical sense (such as prophecy, or the
implications of a subjunctive statement).
c. INDICATING SANSKRIT MIDDLE VOICE (ATMANEPADA)

As noted above, just as the auxiliary verb 34 is used to explicitly indicate the
active-voice (parasmaipada) termination in texts or passages translated from
Sanskrit, the corresponding middle-voice (atmanepada) termination can be
explicitly indicated by the use of the auxiliary verb འགྱུར་. A particular charac-

teristic of the middle-voice termination is that it conveys a reflexive sense to
the verbal action. This sense is carried over into Tibetan and is used both as a
representation of the middle-voice termination and sometimes to simultaneously indicate the perfective (above) as well.
D. INDICATING AN EMPHATIC FUTURE
Seen particularly with Class V and VI verbs, the auxiliary verb འགྱུར་ is used

to explicitly emphasize the future time of an event being described. The sense
is conveyed both in the positive (verb + འགྱུར་) and negative (verb + མི་འགྱུར་)
constructions and overlaps with a weak form of the precative. It is also used in
forming rhetorical questions (verb + མི་འགྱུར་ཞིག་ན་་).
