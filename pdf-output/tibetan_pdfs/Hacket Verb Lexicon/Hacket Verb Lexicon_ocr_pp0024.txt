In constructions involving verbal nouns, however, sometimes the nominalizing lexical particle is omitted, though indicated by declension. For example,
the verbal collocation 24 75%, “to previously have,’ is usually nominalized as
སྔོན་དུ་སོང་བ་, though here its nominalization is implicitly indicated by the subse-

quent postpositional connective (གི་):
དྲ་ག་བཅོམ་རོགས་པ་སོོན་སོང་གི་དབང་དུ་བྱས་ན།

INFINITIVES

A simple infinitive is a verb occuring in a construction that functions as a subordinate phrase, sometimes with its own object. When marked as simple infinitives, these verbs and verb-terminated phrases function in one of a number
of roles: as indirect statements (including indirect speech and reporting inner
thoughts), as activities externally caused or otherwise removed from the action
of the main verb, and as indicating a purpose.

Regarding the first type, in general, indirect speech is a grammatical construction in which the meaning of an event is conveyed descriptively. There
are three distinct types of indirect statements: (1) reporting what something

says without using the exact words (e.g., “the text says that ...”), (2) conveying
the meaning of an event rather than relating the event directly (e.g., “it is the
construction of X” vs. “X was constructed”), and (3) reporting inner thoughts.

All of these are seen and can be represented using simple infinitives.
The second type indicates activities externally caused or otherwise removed
from the action of the main verb. This is seen most commonly with supplications
and prayers since the activity/agency of the subordinate infinitive (the desired ac-

tion) is removed from the action of the main verb (the supplication) and its agent.
The third type is relatively straightforward and is often seen with verbs indicating future activity (such as the verbs འགྲོ་, འོང་, ཡོང་, etc.) as well as the nonreflexive causative verb, 987) /བཅུག་ /6[6. (see below). Some of these are common
enough to be considered collocations (such as གསལ་དུ་སོང་, meaning “to become

manifest”).
AGENTS,

INSTRUMENTS,

AND

OBJECTS

“Agents” are verbal compounds formed through the affixing of the syllables

“cy” or “a'r” (depending on euphony rules). The instrument is built off the
present tense of the verb with “छेद? ’ while the object is built off the future tense
