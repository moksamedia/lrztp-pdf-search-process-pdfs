Here, the categorical divergence arises as a result of the domain of the vocabulary. Although the Tibetan word “ (“path”) does convey both its literal and
metaphorical meaning in most contexts, in some highly technical Buddhist lit-

erature, ལམ་ can refer to a state of mind. Hence, in the example above, the technical usage of the term as employed forces a mutual shift in the verb-predicate
equivalents.

FROM

PRESENTATION

As with the grammatical introduction in the first edition, I do not consider the
presentation of aspects of Tibetan grammar in this book to contradict or supersede Joe Wilson's text. Indeed, I envision it as complementary. However, during
the course of teaching Wilson's presentation of Tibetan grammar in the classroom and implementing it in a computational environment, certain formulaic
additions and supplementary distinctions were perceived to be advantageous.
From that perspective, they are included here.
Chief among these additions is an expanded discussion of verbal collocations (referred to as “phrasal verbs” by Wilson), translation divergences (drawing on the work of Dorr), and a fine-grained classification of auxiliary verbs
and semimodal constructions. Other distinctions made include the explicit
recognition of various distinct syntactic patterns and particles such as the loca-

tive-absolute construction, certain verb participles, and additional differentiations in labeling syntactic particles. All of these are explained in the sections

that follow.

Classification of Tibetan Verbs
A verb is an argument-taking lexical item that denotes an action, state, or process involving one or more participants. To know the meaning of a verb is to
know both the number and type of arguments it requires and the semantic
relationship each argument has with the verb. The premise of this lexicon, Joe
Wilson's presentation of Tibetan grammar, and other linguistic approaches’ is
that this set of properties built around the predicate-argument structure (or
subcategorization frame) of a verb yields a classificatory scheme from which

someone may infer the basic structure of a sentence based primarily on the
terminal verb and the number and type of accompanying arguments.
Historically, Tibetan discussions of grammar date back to the grammatical
