treatises attributed to Thonmi Sambhota. In these texts and subsequent commentaries, Tibetan verbs are divided into three categories based on the dominant relational characteristics of their arguments: tha dad (“different”), tha
mi dad (“not different”), and rjes mthun (“concordant”). In terms of function,
however, these traditional verbal categories lack sufficient distinctions to serve
as the basis of a fully descriptive system. Wilson's categories, on the other hand,
provide a substantial basis for a rigorous verb subcategorization scheme. This
subcategorization often, though not always, follows a variation in the number

and types of arguments and sense. Different classes—as one might suspect—
have different subcategorization profiles (also known as “alternations” or “syntactic frames”). As testimony to their validity, moreover, these categories can be

seen to be nonconflictive and coextensive in coverage with Wilson's categories
(see figure 1).
