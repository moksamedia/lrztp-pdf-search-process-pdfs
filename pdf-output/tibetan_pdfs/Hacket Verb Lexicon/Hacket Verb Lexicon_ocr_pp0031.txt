forms the future perfect causative (or emphatic). The same holds for the honorific forms, *&4" and བགྱིས་.

OTHER

COMMON

AUXILIARY

CONSTRUCTIONS

A. IMPERATIVE
A present-tense verb followed by ཅིག་, or an imperative with ཤིག་, etc. forms

the simple imperative. This should not be confused with the precative (see
below).

B. PASSIVE IMPERATIVE
The passive imperative is formed with the future tense of the main verb combined with the imperative form of the auxiliary verb 35, 38”. The same holds
true for the honorific passive imperative using མཛོད་ and 95’,
C. COMPLETED ACTION AUXILIARIES

The auxiliary verb 2% is used to indicate the past perfect with Class II, III, and
IV verbs, while the auxiliary verb བོད་་ is used to indicate the past perfect with
Class V and VI verbs, although ཟིན་ can also be used with Class V and VI verbs
when indicating the passive past perfect.
Similarly, the verb के can be used to indicate the perfect. For example,

when occuring with the future tense of another verb, it is used to indicate the
future perfect.
D. PRECATIVE, PERFORMATIVE, AND EXHORTATIVE
The precative is an auxiliary verb construction that is used to express a wish or

request; it can be thought of as an aspirational imperative. It is most commonly
formed by combining the imperative form of a verb with गण, ཅིག་, or ཞིག་ and in
the honorific with 7&7,
The precative causative is formed in a similar manner with བྱེད་ཞིག་ and the
passive precative causative with verb + པར་གྱིས་. While an even stronger form,
an exhortative (a strong imperative/deontic) is formed with གྱིས་ཞིག་ 3114 བྱེད་ཅིག་
and in the honorific with མཛོད་ཅིག་

A strong precative form bordering on the performative (a statement that
becomes true through its utterance) is formed by combining the present-tense

form of a verb शांत གྱུར་ཅིག་.
A weak form of the precative can also be formed with མ་གྱུར་ and མི་འགྱུར་.
