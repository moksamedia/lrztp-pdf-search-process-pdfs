Grammatical aims of this lesson
After studying this lesson you will be able to use many more secondary verbs, for example:
®

to know how to do X

@

to have time to do X
for it to be time to do X

to intend, plan to do X

The secondary verbs ཤེས་པ།, ལོང་བ།› རན་པ།། Svs, ཆོག་པ།, སྲིད་པ།, རྱོང་བ། and the special
case བསམ་པ།

The only thing these secondary verbs have in common

is that they follow after a Present tense verb.

The

following sections introduce them one by one.

a)

ཤེས་པ། (to know how to do X)

ཤེས་པ་ can be used as a full verb and as a secondary verb. According to most native speakers, it is considered
ཐ་མི་དད་པ་ in Tibetan even though it takes a direct object in English.
For example:
A

=

~

རས

AN

ངས་དྱབན་ཇེའ་སྐད་ཡག་པོ་རང་ཤེས་ཀྱེ་མད།
I do not know the English language very well.
Here, ཤས་པ་ 1$ used as a full or main verb since there is no other verb in the sentence.

ངའི་རོགས་པས་སྲག་སྲག་གཏོང་ཤེས་ཀྱི་ཡོད་རེད།
My friend knows how to ride a motorbike.
Since there is another verb (སྲག་སྲག་གཏོང་བ།) immediately preceding it, ཤེས་པ། is used here as a secondary verb.
Some

people place ཡག་ between the main verb and ཤེས་པ།: but this is not necessary. ཤེས་པ། is conjugated

according to what the sentence tries to convey and is considered non-volitional.
What is meant by the notion of the sentence?
