The Connective Particle འབེལ་ས།
The next particle to become familiar with is the connective particle འབེལ་ས།. As its name suggests,
this particle is inserted between two words in order to connect or link them. The འབེལ་ས་ is a
dependent particle ཕྲད་གཞན་དབང་ཅན།. It has five different spellings which apply according to the
suffix རེས་འཇུག་ of the word to which it is attached. The spelling rules are as follows:
རེས་འཇུག Suffix
ག་ ང་
ད་ བ་ ས་
ན་ མ་ ར་ ལ་
འ་ or no suffix

ཕྲད། Particle
གི་
ཀི་
གི་
འི་ / ཡི་

In Latin grammatical terms, the connective particle has the function of the genitive case and is
therefore often translated with an apostrophe or “of”.

The question particles are formally introduced in Lesson 4, but an example has been given here with ཁེད་རང་ to
show how their usage more often than not turns a sentence into a question rather than a statement.
