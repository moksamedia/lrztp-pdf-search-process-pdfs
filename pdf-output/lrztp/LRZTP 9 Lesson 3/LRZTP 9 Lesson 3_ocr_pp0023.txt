Something to look forward to in your future language learning career: Within honorific arr, there
are still various levels — honorific of honorific: words which we only use when talking about
realized beings such as His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

When will His Holiness go (HH) to Ladakh?
And also, there are a few really funny honorific words, such as ཆབ་གསང་ “the secret water” (H)
(meaning: toilet, urine), ཞབས་སྐོར་ “foot round” (11) (meaning: circumambulation), etc.

Usage of ཞེ་ས།
Among

the three provinces in Tibet, honorific language

is mostly used in U-Tsang

and most

specifically in Lhasa. Since people from Lhasa tend to use honorific language always, even when
talking to their own children, jokes such as “they probably use it even for dogs and beggars”
circulate in Tibetan society.
The contemplation about whether and why this is the correct use of ཞེ་ས་ shall be left to the
individual. However, a good initial thought might be: “Isn’t it wonderful that people from Lhasa
talk respectfully to and about everybody - other than themselves?”

The One and Most Important Rule: Never Use ཞེ་ས་ for Yourself!
Since many people from Kham and Amdo do not have a strong habit of using honorific language,
they even sometimes fall into the same trap as beginner Tibetan language learners and use it for
themselves, answering the question:

An Advice
So, there is nothing to be worried about ཞེ་ས་ at this point for you! The above elaborations are more
of an introduction

to an important

and

beautiful

feature

of Tibetan

language

— rather than

grammatical explanations to be memorized.
For day one, it is good to just remember the syllable ལགས་, which can be called an honorific
marker, added after names, titles, short answers — and many more occasions!

ཕལ་སྐད་ Ordinary Colloquial Language and ཞེ་ས་རྐང་ཆག་ Honorific (with) Broken Legs
Non-honorific language is called RIANA

the meaning of which ranges from ordinary colloquial

speech, dialect and slang.
Correctly speaking, in one sentence, one should use all possible ཞེ་ས་ words; one should not, for

example, just use the honorific noun, leaving the others in ordinary language (ཕལ་སྐད་). Since by far
not all words have an honorific equivalent, I say “all possible words.” This mistake however is also
often made even by native speakers and therefore has a particular name: ཞེ་ས་རྐང་ཆག་ - honorific

(with) broken legs. ©
