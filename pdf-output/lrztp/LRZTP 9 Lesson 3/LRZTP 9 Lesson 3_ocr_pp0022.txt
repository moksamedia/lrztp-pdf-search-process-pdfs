You may have started pondering, “...but what is the difference between མཚན་ and མེང་ and ཞུ་ and

HONORIFIC LANGUAGE

ཞེ་ས།

Introduction
The

fact that this short Tibetan

sentence

authentic taste of ཞེ་ས་ (honorific),
;

།

ORI

requires

three different language

registers gives an

a peculiar feature of the Tibetan language

world you are

a

entering. Welcome! ཕྱག་ཕེབས་གནང་བྱུང་།
As a beginner language student, it is of course not (yet) the moment to be too concerned about
this vast topic and its complicated rules. But, very pragmatically

speaking:

since

some words

pertaining to the honorific language register are commonly used in simple casual conversations, it
is important to become aware of them. In this book, ཞེ་ས་ will be marked by a capital letter (11).

The Meaning
What does honorific mean? As the name tells, it is a language register used to express oneself in a
more respectful way. This concept might be easier to understand for German, Italian, French and
Spanish than to English native speakers.

Why?

Unlike

in these other European

languages,

in

modern Colloquial English, one always uses “you,” regardless whether you are addressing your
teacher or a three-year old child.
However, even unlike these other languages, which have honorifics for pronouns, in Tibetan,
there are also honorifics for nouns, verbs and adjectives. For example:
sia’ is the honorific of: 5

(name)

eyarey is the honorific of: འགྲོ་བ་ (to go)

ey is the honorific of སྐྱིད་པོ་ (pleasant, happy)
