You may have started pondering, “…but what is the difference between མཚན་ and མིང་ and ཞུ་ and
ཟེར་?!” Hopefully the explanations below will shed some light on these doubts!
HONORIFIC LANGUAGE
ཞེ་ས།
Introduction
The fact that this short Tibetan sentence requires three different language registers gives an
authentic taste of ཞེ་ས་ (honorific), a peculiar feature of the Tibetan language world you are
entering. Welcome! ཕྱག་ཕེབས་གནང་བྱུང་།
As a beginner language student, it is of course not (yet) the moment to be too concerned about
this vast topic and its complicated rules. But, very pragmatically speaking: since some words
pertaining to the honorific language register are commonly used in simple casual conversations, it
is important to become aware of them. In this book, ཞེ་ས་ will be marked by a capital letter (H).
The Meaning
What does honorific mean? As the name tells, it is a language register used to express oneself in a
more respectful way. This concept might be easier to understand for German, Italian, French and
Spanish than to English native speakers. Why? Unlike in these other European languages, in
modern Colloquial English, one always uses “you,” regardless whether you are addressing your
teacher or a three-year old child.
However, even unlike these other languages, which have honorifics for pronouns, in Tibetan,
there are also honorifics for nouns, verbs and adjectives. For example:
མཚན་ is the honorific of: མིང་ (name)
ཕེབས་པ་ is the honorific of: འགོ་བ་ (to go)
སོ་པོ་ is the honorific of སིད་པོ་ (pleasant, happy)
