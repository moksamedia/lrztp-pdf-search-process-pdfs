LRZTP 9 Module 2 — Lesson 14, August 2023
meaning of both is the same, 1.e. "because" or "after."
Some Tibetans say that ནས་ should never follow a negated verb. The argument is that
one cannot reasonably talk about "after" if the first action hasn't actually taken place.
Therefore, one wouldn’t say:* ངས་ཚིག་མ་སྦྱང་ནས་འཇཛིན་གྲྭ་ལ་མགོ་འཐོམ་སོང་།

(1 got confused

in class because I had not learnt the words.) Instead, these Tibetans would use SR or བྱས.
However, it should be noted that not all Tibetans stick to this rule.

The connector ན་ཡང་ — “though”, “although”, “even though”, “despite”
Introduction
This connector carries
showing

a reason,

a meaning that 18 the opposite of the one discussed above. Instead of

it shows

a contradiction

or opposite.

It is nonetheless

convenient

to

introduce them both in the same lesson, since their position within the sentence and way to

connect to the verb and auxiliaries pertaining to བདག are the same.

The conjugations of ན་

w& are the same as with only ན་.

Literal meaning
It may also help you to think in terms of "even if", "also if", etc, - since this is what ན་ཡང་

literally means.
ཡིན་ནའི་ is a short version of the expression ཡིན་ན་ཡང་, used in certain dialects. Their
meaning is exactly the same.
Two short sentences
Until now, you would have formed the following two short sentences, starting the second
one with "but" or "however":

ཁོང་བོད་པ་རེད། ཡིན་ནའི་བོད་ཇ་ལ་དགའ་པོ་ཡོད་མ་རེད།
She is (a) Tibetan. But she doesn't like Tibetan tea.
