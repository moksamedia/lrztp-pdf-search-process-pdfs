LRZTP 9 Module 2 — Lesson 14, August 2023

Connecting two sentences into one
The most common practice is to put S@& in the middle of the sentence. You should make an
effort to get used to this, even if it feels a bit unusual in the beginning. Being able to use @&
will allow you to speak in a more concise and eloquent way rather than just making short
simple sentences. Tibetans tend to use གང་ཡིན་ཟེར་ན་: etc. less than Tibetan language students.
The formula remains the same, regardless of the tense or mode of the verb which we will
now take a look at, one by one.

a) Sc with the verbs "to be" and "to have"
As always, it is important to remember the grammatical distinction between
existential.

There

is, however,

no distinction made

in terms

essentia/ and

of evidence where

SR"

is

involved. Where the auxiliary would normally be either ཡོད་རེད་ or འདུ་ག, both become ཡོད་

when they precede ཛཱ. For example:
Both

དོན་གྲུབ་ལ་དངུལ་མང་པོ་འདུག

and

Ra

VARGA

aR

NORA]

end up being:

དོན་གུབ་ལ་དངལ་མང་པོ་ཡོད་ཙང་སྦྱེན་པ་གཏོང་གི་ཡོད་རེད།
Because Dondrub has plenty of money, he practices generosity.
As mentioned earlier, this is to emphasise the personal perspective of the speaker.
ང་བོད་པ་མིན་ཙང་བོད་ཇ་ལ་དགའ་པོ་ཞེ་དྲག་མེད།
Since I am not (a) Tibetan, I don't like Tibetan tea very much.

བྲཀ་ཤིས་བོད་པ་ཡིན་ཙང་གངས་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་མཛལ་གར་ཕེབས་རྱོང་ཡོད་རེད།
As Tashi is (a) Tibetan, he has been to Mount Kailash.
ངའི་ཨ་མ་ལགས ་ནང་ལ་མེད་ཙང་ དྭ་ལྟ་མ་ཕེབས་རོགས གནཞང་།

Since my mother is not at home, please do not come right now!

b) S& with any full verb
In the present and past tense, there are two options, either to put the Sc” directly after the
verb or after the auxiliary (pertaining to བདག)
