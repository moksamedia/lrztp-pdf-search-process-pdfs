LRZTP 9 Module 1 — Lesson 5, May-June 2023

Do you go to school?/Are you going to school?
Remember from lesson 4 that verbs pertaining to བདག are used when your question is about ཁྱེད་རང་།.
Different Types of Verbs

Volitional and Non-Volitional Verbs

བྱེད་འབྲེལ་ལས་ཚིག་དང་བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག

Volition
Another interesting peculiarity of the Tibetan language is that, when speaking about oneself, one a/ways distinguishes between
performing the action of a verb intentionally or accidentally. Thus all verbs may be divided into volitional (vol.) and nonvolitional (non-vol.).
However, sometimes we do things accidentally which we usually do with intention. (For example, drinking somebody else’s tea
by mistake).

So, rather than dividing them into two fixed categories, just be aware in every sentence whether you did the action

on purpose or by accident/without intention.

Related to an Agent
The volitional ones are called: བྱེད་འབྲེལ་ལས་ཚིག which is short of: བྱེད་པ་པོ་དང་འབྲེལ་བ་ཡོད་པའི་ལས་ཚིག (action which is connected,
related to an agent (who has volition)).

And likewise, non-volitional ones are called: བྱེད་མེ

་ལས་ཚིག, which is short for: བྱེད་པ་པོ་

དང་འབྲེལ་བ་མེད་པའི་ལས་ཚིག (action which is unrelated to the agent). Note that here the word ལས་ཚིག replaces བྱ་ཚིག verb. aay
means “karma’ or action.

Resultative Verbs
According to some native speakers, students are advised to perceive the བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག as always being the resu/t of a related

བྱེད་འབྲེལ་ལས་ཚིག.
Their explanations are very sound and it is a pleasant mental exercise to imagine what the related བྱེད་འབྲེལ་ལས་ཚིག of each བྱེད་
མེད་ལས་ཚིག might be.

Examples of Results
So, for example, ཆ།ཁྲོང་བ།་ (to see), is the result of SA (to look at); གོ་བ་(༠ hear) is the result of ཉན་པ་(༠ listen to); ཤེས་པ་((༠

know) results from སྦྱོང་བ་((༠ learn). Furthermore, (ཁཁོ་ར་བ་་([0 spin on its own) only becomes possible if there was somebody who

did the སྐོར་བ་ (to spin actively).
Auxiliaries
It needs a bit of “getting used to” that as soon as we start a sentence about ourselves, we need to be aware of this issue of
volition (and thus choose the correct auxiliary) — but is a good training of mindfulness.
Following the logic of the auxiliaries introduced earlier, it is needless to say that བྱེད་འབྲེལ་ལས་ཚིག will be formed with the
auxiliaries pertaining to བདག. And the བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག - which are happening to oneself, which are a result and dependent on
external conditions - therefore use the auxiliaries pertaining to གཞན་་
For example, when saying: “I’m drinking a cup of tea,” one uses the volitional auxiliary, གི་ཡོད།.

ང་
1

ང་
tea

གང་

འཐུང་

full

drink

ae

གི་ཡོད།
(present, vol.)

I’m drinking a cup of tea.
When saying, “I see a cat,” one uses the non-volitional auxiliary གི་འདུག, since the seeing happens without effort or intention.
