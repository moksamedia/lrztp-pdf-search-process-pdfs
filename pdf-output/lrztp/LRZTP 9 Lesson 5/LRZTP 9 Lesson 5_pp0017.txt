For example:
To write = བིས་(past)
To eat = བཟས་(past)
To drink = འཐུངས་(past)

འབི་(present)
ཟ་(present)
འཐུང་(present)

བི་(future)
བཟའ་(future)
བཏུང་(future)

More than half of all verbs use the same form for all three tenses:
To see =
མཐོང་ (past)
མཐོང་ (present/future)
A Very Important Side Note – For Later Reference
You also need to be aware that there is often a slight discrepancy between what the rule dictates and what people
actually say.
For example:
to send = བཏང་ (past)
གཏོང་ (present)
བཏང་(future)
to go = ཕིན་
(past)
འགོ་
(present/future)
to make =
བརྒྱབ་ (past)
རྒྱག་ (present) བརྒྱབ་ (future)
to stay, live = བསད་ (past)
སོད་ (present) བསད་ (future)
to give =
སྤྲད་ (past)
སྤྲོད་པ་ (present/future)
to learn =
སངས་ (past)
སོང་བ་ (present)
སང་ (future)
People very commonly use གཏང་, བརྒྱབ་, བསད་, སྤྲད་ and སང་ for the present/future tense and འགོ་ for the past tense.
And for reasons of accuracy it needs to be mentioned here also that in literary Tibetan, the present and future form of
the verb are not always the same.
For example: “to write” འབི་བ་ is present, བི་བ་ is future,
“to learn” སོང་བ་ is present, སང་བ་ is future,
“to send” གཏོང་བ་ is present, གཏང་བ་ is future.
So, as mentioned above, when we say “tang” for present tense – which people commonly do – it could actually be
seen as its བཏང་ or its future གཏང་.
For a beginner student, it is fine if you think of present and future being the same – but be aware that in terms of
literary Tibetan, this is not true.
Further Examples to Illustrate the Use of Auxiliaries in the Three Times
With ང་, in most cases ཡིན། is used. The full verb འགོ་ is the same for both present and future:
ང་
སོབ་གྲྭ་ལ་ འགོ་
གི་ཡིན།
I
to school go (full verb)
(future auxiliary, positive)
I will go to school.
བཀྲ་ཤིས་
སོབ་གྲྭ་ལ་
ཕིན་
Tashi
to school to go (full verb, past)
Tashi went to school.

པ་རེད།
(past auxiliary)

Tashi, who is གཞན་, requires a པ་རེད། ཕིན་ is the past form of the verb འགོ་བ་
ཁེད་རང་ སོབ་གྲྭ་ལ་ འགོ་
གི་ཡོད་པས།
you
to school to go (full verb) (pres aux. with question particle)
