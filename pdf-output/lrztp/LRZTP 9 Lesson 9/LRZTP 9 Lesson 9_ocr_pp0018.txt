སྐུལ་ཚིག The Imperative
There

are various ways

Lesson

1, Colloquial

to express

Tibetan

does

the imperative in Tibetan. As mentioned
not really

have

punctuation.

So, you

in

may

perceive some of the imperative markers below as an exclamation mark. And even
if there is no such marker in your Tibetan sentence, you need to put one in your

English one, as they are all imperatives.
a) One

can simply put the present tense of the verb at the end of the sentence

without any auxiliary:

ཡི་གེ་བྲིས།

Write the letter!

And its negation:
རི་མོ་མ་བྲིས།

Don’t draw a picture! (lit. “write’’)

Since it is clear from the context, in most cases, the pronoun

(ཁྱེད་རང་: Sa

or

ཁྱེད་རྣམ་ཚོ་) is omitted. Some people might suggest you to use it and say it is more
correct. But it seems that more often than not, it is clear who is addressed and the
pronoun is understood as being implied. The negation particle དགག་སྒྲ་ precedes the

verb and therefore comes towards the end and not in the beginning as in the English
sentence.

b) Some imperative forms are expressed by changing the vowel into a ན་རོ་
with: ཟྲ་བ་ (“to eat”), ཉན་པ་ (“to listen’’), gwar (“to sleep”), ey
at’), etc. For example:

ཁ་ལག་ཟོ།

Eat (the) food!
