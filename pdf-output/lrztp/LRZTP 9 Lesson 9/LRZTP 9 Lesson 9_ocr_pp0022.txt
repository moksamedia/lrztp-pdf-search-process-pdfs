Additional Info
The term ཤོག has another function which is used mainly in literary language. It
means “may x happen.” There are cases where we use it in colloquial too. For
example:

ཁྱེད་རང་ན་ཚ་མགྱོགས་པོར་དྲག་པར་ཤོག
May you recover swiftly from your disease!

སང་ཉིན་ནམ་གཤིས་སྐྱིད་པོ་ཡོང་བར་ཤོག
May we have good weather tomorrow!
འཛམ་གླིང་ལ་ཞི་བདེ་ཡོང་བར་ཤོག
May peace prevail on earth!
d) The particle དོ། is added if the speaker themselves is included in the imperative
request.

It can be translated with

“Let us....” One

still uses the honorific if the

situation requires it. For example:

ཁ་ལག་མཉམ་དུ་ཟ་དོ།

Let's eat together!

གློག་བརྙན་ཁང་ལ་ཕེབས་དོ།

Let's go to the movie hall! (11)

དེ་རིང་དགོན་པ་མཛལ་དོ།

Let's visit the monastery today! (11)

In these sentences, we sometimes do use the pronoun &’&’. But even if we do not, it
is implied. It might seem strange for you to use the honorific in a sentence starting
with <’&’, but it is grammatically speaking correct and of course refers to the other
persons — or in the case of the last sentence, to the monastery. Doesn’t this tell you

something interesting about the Tibetan culture?
Also, be aware that not everybody uses དོ། and some people might even go as far
as to say that it is unnecessary

or incorrect. These people would

sentence, just leaving out the དོ།. So, they’d just say:
ང་ཚོ་ཁ་ལག་མཉམ་དུ་ཟ།

(Let us) eat together!

ང་ཚོ་དགོན་པ་མཛལ།

(Let us) visit the monastery! ([1)
