present perfect tense, as we will see in the next lesson. I believe that it is saying “I do not/did
not have the action” and this is why we say: “མེད་”. You can determine what you think the
reason is.
Regardless, it is important to remember: People say “མེད་” as the negation of “པ་ཡིན་” and
not: པ་མིན་ or: མིན་.
But, is སོང་། really new? Or haven’t you used it a hundred times in the past weeks, saying:
ཧ་གོ་སོང་། or: ཧ་གོ་མ་སོང་། - once in a while?  So, today, finally you will fully understand
why it is said in this way.
Volition
The reason is simple and logical: ཧ་གོ་བ་ is a བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག (non-volitional verb). In order to
express that absence of volition, one uses the auxiliaries pertaining to གཞན་. Among the two
choices, direct or inferential knowledge, since the verb happens to oneself, one actually
experiences it and has direct knowledge of the verb – and therefore (mostly) uses the
auxiliary སོང་། rather than པ་རེད།.
Examples
If you want to express that you went to the temple yesterday, you first decide whether you
did this intentionally or it just happened to you.
In the case of འགོ་བ་ (and its past tense ཕིན་པ་), as it is something you have control over,
you then use the auxiliary pertaining to བདག.
So, you say:
ང་ ལ་ཁང་ལ་
ཕིན་
པ་ཡིན།
I
temple to go (past)
auxiliary (past vol.)
I went to the temple.
Whereas if you want to say that you had a headache yesterday, again, you first reflect on
whether this was your choice or not – a rather easy decision. In order to express that absence
of intention, you therefore pick the auxiliary pertaining to གཞན་ and you end up saying:
ཁ་སང་
ང་
མགོ་ན་
སོང་།
yesterday I
have headache
auxiliary (past direct)
Yesterday, I had a headache.
Evidence
Just as with “to have” when talking about others, you always express whether your
knowledge is direct or inferential.
