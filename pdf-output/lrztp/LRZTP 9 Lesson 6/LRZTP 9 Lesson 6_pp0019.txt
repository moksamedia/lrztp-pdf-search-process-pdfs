past does not, b) that the ས་ is added as a suffix which changes the vowel into an umlaut and
c) the prefix བ་ occurs often.
None of these are very important for you at this beginner stage because people are flexible
about them, as you’ll see below. For example:
Present
སྡོད་པ་
གཏོང་བ་
ཤོད་པ་
སྦྱོང་བ་

Loss of “o” Sound:
Past
བསྡད་པ་ (to stay, live, sit)
གཏང་བ་ (to send & used with other nouns)
བཤད་པ་ (to say, speak)
སྦྱངས་པ་ (to learn)

Present
ཉོ་བ་
བྱེད་པ་
ཟ་བ་
བཟོ་བ་
ལྟ་བ་

Addition of ས་ Suffix – Umlaut
Past
ཉོས་པ་ (to buy)
བྱས་པ་ (to do, but also verbalizer)
བཟས་པ་ (to eat)
བཟོས་པ་ (to make)
བལྟས་པ་ (to look at, to watch, to read)
བ་ Prefix

Present
རྒྱག་པ་
ཤོད་པ་
གཏོང་བ་

Past
བརྒྱབ་པ་ (to make, also used as verbalizer)
བཤད་པ་ (to say, to express)
བཏང་པ་ (to send, also used as verbalizer)

For your information: These spelling variations mostly derive from literary Tibetan, where there
are no auxiliaries but the (spelling of the) actual verb changes according to the different tenses.
