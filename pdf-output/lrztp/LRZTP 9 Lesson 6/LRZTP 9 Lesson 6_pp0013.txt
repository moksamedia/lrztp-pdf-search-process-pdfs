LRZTP 9 Module 1 – Lesson 6, June 2023
As in other languages, the simple past is used for actions which were performed in the
past and do not have any particular connection to the present. Obviously, the main verb is in
the past tense (if the particular verb has such a form).
Different Notions
As introduced in Lesson 5, there are various peculiar Tibetan notions which one needs to
keep in mind in order to pick the right auxiliary. Or the other way around: the various
auxiliaries are able to unambiguously express the particular notions.
In any of the three tenses, when talking about oneself, the different forms make strict
distinctions with respect to volition.
As in the case of “to have,” when talking about others, different auxiliaries are used to
express direct or inferential knowledge. There is even a distinction made as to whether one
actually saw the action or only the result of it.
Still, the past tense seems to be the most grammatically complex of the three times (past,
present and future). However, since most of our conversations revolve around the past, it
seems to be best to learn the past tense first.
The Simple Past
The following is the set of auxiliaries that are used to express an action completed in the past.

པ་རེད།

མ་སོང་།

པ་ཡིན།
མེད།

Having understood from Lesson 5 the concept and function of an auxiliary, the table is quite
self-explanatory; there is not much mystery to it and the only new bit is སོང་། and པ་. པ་ seems
to be the perfect syllable to express past tense as it is the first half of the word “past”.
There are two theories about why people say “མེད་” as a negation of “པ་ཡིན་” Some
Tibetans hold that it should actually be “མིན་” but then people just pronounce it “མེད་” I want
to believe that it is a bit more profound, and that it is actually said on purpose. “མེད་” is
