ཐ་དད་པ་ and ཐ་མི་དད་པ་ and the བྱེད་སྒྲ་ Agentive Particle
So, technically speaking, the third thing you always decide in your mind about the verb is
whether it is ཐ་དད་པ་ OF ཐ་མི་དད་པ་་
According to the Tibetan way of thinking, since the past is not within reach of one's actual
eyesight, agent and object are more easily mixed up. Therefore, in the past tense one uses the
agentive marker བྱེད་སྒྲ་ with ཐ་དད་པ་ verbs — where agent and object are distinct from one
another.
To be able to fully distinguish every single verb as being one of the two is a higher
philosophy that not even all native speakers would agree upon. At your beginner stage,
therefore, this is nothing you should be concerned about.
Remember: Most verbs are ROA,

the most common ཐ་མི་དད་པ་ ones are motion verbs: འགྲོ་

བ་ (to go), Sine (to stay, //།7©), ཕེ་བས་པ། (to come, go (H)), etc. and all བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག (nonvolitional) verbs are ཐ་མི་དད་པ་་
Since the agentive particle is attached to the pronoun, if the context is clear, but you are not
sure about the verb being ཐ་དད་པ་ Or PAOLA,

just leave out the pronoun!

Some people

might consider this to not be completely correct, but it is very common in colloquial speech.
