g and ཆུ།
Tibetan doctors can identify certain
diseases merely by checking
the patient's X (pulse, veins).
For example, based on the x,

a trained physician is able to analyze whether the
ao (winds) in the body
are in balance or out of balance.
In the case of imbalance / illness,

the patient will have to consume
ཚྭ་སྨན་ (Tibetan herbal medicines)
which can be quite ཁ་ཏིག་ (bitter).
Moreover, the FHF

should be

taken regularly, over a long period
and mostly with
ཆུ་འདྲོད་འཇམ་, lukewarm water.
