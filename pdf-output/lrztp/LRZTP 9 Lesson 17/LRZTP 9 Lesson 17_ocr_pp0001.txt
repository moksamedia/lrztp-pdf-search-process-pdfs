DID YOU KNOW...?

བྱ་ཤ།ཉ་ཤ། གཡག་ཤ།
Tibetans consider it worse to eat བྱ་ཤ་ 3114 aa (chicken and fish)
than གཡག་ཤ་ (yak meat). Why? It is because of their s7ze— one needs
to take more lives in order to get the same amount of meat.

སྦྱོད་པ་འཚེ་མེད།
In accordance with the Buddhist principle of སྤྱོད་པ ་འཚེ་མེད། (the conduct
of non-violence), certain valleys in the Himalayan region (e.g. Tsum in
Nepal) are proclaimed as “non-killing zones.” This means that people
living there try only to eat the meat of animals which have died
naturally/accidentally.

ངན་སོང་གསུམ།
In Tibetan Buddhism, animals are considered to belong to one of the
ངན་སོང་གསུམ། (the three lower realms). The other two are
the དྭ་མལ་བ་ (hell beings) and ཡི་དྭགས་ (hungry ghosts).

ཁྱིའི་རྣམ་ཤེས།
However, it is also believed that dogs have a good chance to be reborn as
humans. For this reason, in certain regions, the skull of a dead dog
is broken so that the gar

Aer (consciousness of the dog) can leave

the body and find its way into the human realm.

གངས་སེང་།
The གངས་སེང་།

(snow lion) which adorns the Tibetan flag
is not an actual animal.
