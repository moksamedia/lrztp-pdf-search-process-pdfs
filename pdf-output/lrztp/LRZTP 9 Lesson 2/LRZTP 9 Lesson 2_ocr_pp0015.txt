LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023

For later reference:
There are occasions where any of the four verbs — རེད། ཡོད་རེད།, འདུག, ཡོད། — could apply

in the same sentence, for example with adjectives:

བཀྲ་ཤེས

Tashi

ཡག་པོ

oe

Tashi is a good person.

is.

Tashi is a good person.
These four sentences can be translated identically into English. The differences are
very subtle:
e

The first example has a sense of Tashi's nature being good.

e

The second suggests Tashi as Having good qualities.

e

The third expresses that the speaker is just discovering that Tashi is a good guy.

e

The fourth emphasises the speaker's relationship to Tashi. The translation in this case
could become: “Trust me, Tashi is a good guy,” or “I know that Tashi is a good guy.”

In terms of བདག and གཞན་ (self and other), the first three sentences relate to གཞན་ (other)
— the differences of which will be elaborated upon later in this lesson. The last one, Qa

ཤིས་མི་ཡག་པོ་ཡོད། is of a particular interest. The speaker chooses to say ཡོད།, which pertains
to བདག, to emphasise that (s)he is not talking about an objective fact but rather a personal
point of view. This is why it can be translated as: “Trust me,” “I know...” etc.
