Further Cases of Using ཡིན། to Make an Emphasis
When we give an order or express our opinion, we often use ཡིན། to emphasize that it is
our own decision and choice. For example, His Holiness often says in the teachings:
ངའི་འཆར་གཞི་དེ་ཙམ་ཡིན་ད།
This is roughly my plan.
And (traditional) Tibetan teachers tend to say to their students:
མཉམ་དུ་ཡིན་ད།
(I order: Let us read/spell/recite this) together!
When somebody chooses you to do something, (s)he will point at you and say:
ཁེད་རང་ཡིན་ད།
(I decide that) you are (the one).
If you would like to emphasize your point of view, you would say:
འདི་ངའི་བསམ་ཚུལ་ཡིན་ད།
This is my opinion
ད་ག་རང་ཡིན་ད།
This is exactly it (what I mean to say).
The ད་ will formally be explained in a later lesson. It can be translated as an exclamation
mark, or just emphasizer – and therefore often comes together with ཡིན།.
As a beginner, it is fine if you always use ཡིན་ when talking about yourself and རེད་ when
talking about others. However, it is good if you are aware that the boundaries are actually
more flexible than this. That said, choosing one or the other is not a random matter. There
are particular situations where you'd choose to say རེད་ for yourself, such as when telling
something others might or should know. If you wish to emphasize your relationship with
somebody you do so by choosing ཡིན་ rather than རེད།
