has its own unique system of “cases,” namely the eight-fold རྣམ་དབྱེ་ division. Interestingly,
the ལ་དོན་particle is used for three of the eight divisions – the second, fourth and seventh.
For a complete overview of the eight-fold རྣམ་དབྱེ་ division, please consult the appendix.

The ལ་དོན་ in its function with the verb to have:
The verb “to have” in Tibetan is the same as the verb “to be.” The only difference is that, for
the verb “to have”, the “possessor” is marked with the particle ལ་.
ང་

ལ་

དེབ་

ཡོད།

This sentence construction clearly illustrates how there are times when the grammatical
terms used in English do not apply in Tibetan. In an English sentence, the person is the
subject and the thing possessed is the object. In Tibetan the possessor is marked with the
particle ལ་ and is not the grammatical subject.
The forms and nuances relating to direct / testimonial versus inferential knowledge remain
the same. For example:
ང་
ལ་
གོགས་པོ་
མང་པོ་ ཡོད།
me
by/at friends
many are/have
I have many friends.
ང་
ལ་
དངུལ་
མེད།
me
at/to
money
have not/is not
I do not have (any) money.
