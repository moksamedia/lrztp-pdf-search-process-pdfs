LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023

For later reference:
There are occasions where any of the four verbs – རེད།, ཡོད་རེད།, འདུག, ཡོད། – could apply
in the same sentence, for example with adjectives:
བཀྲ་ཤིས་
མི་
ཡག་པོ་
རེད།
Tashi
person
good
is
Tashi is a good person.
བཀྲ་ཤིས་
མི་
ཡག་པོ་
ཡོད་རེད།
Tashi
person
good
is
Tashi is a good person.
བཀྲ་ཤིས་
མི་
ཡག་པོ
འདུག
Tashi
person
good
is
Tashi is a good person.
བཀྲ་ཤིས་
མི་
ཡག་པོ་
ཡོད།
Tashi
person
good
is.
Tashi is a good person.
These four sentences can be translated identically into English. The differences are
very subtle:
 The first example has a sense of Tashi's nature being good.
 The second suggests Tashi as having good qualities.
 The third expresses that the speaker is just discovering that Tashi is a good guy.
 The fourth emphasises the speaker's relationship to Tashi. The translation in this case
could become: “Trust me, Tashi is a good guy,” or “I know that Tashi is a good guy.”
In terms of བདག and གཞན་ (self and other), the first three sentences relate to གཞན་ (other)
– the differences of which will be elaborated upon later in this lesson. The last one, བཀྲ་
ཤིས་མི་ཡག་པོ་ཡོད། is of a particular interest. The speaker chooses to say ཡོད།, which pertains
to བདག, to emphasise that (s)he is not talking about an objective fact but rather a personal
point of view. This is why it can be translated as: “Trust me,” “I know…” etc.
