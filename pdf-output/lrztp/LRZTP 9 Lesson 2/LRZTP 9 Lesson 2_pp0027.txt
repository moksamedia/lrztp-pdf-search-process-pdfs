Extra grammar note
Also in the existential context, འདུག can be placed to oneself, if the situation requires it.
For example, the speaker is not sure whether or not he has brought a pen and so searches
for it in his bag.
Depending on how the search ends, he will say:
ང་ ལ་ སྨྱུ་གུ་ འདུག
me by pen is/have
(I see), I have a pen.
or:
ང་ ལ་ སྨྱུ་གུ་ མི་འདུག
དགོངས་དག
me by pen is not/have not
Sorry!
Sorry, I don't have a pen.
In terms of the translation into English, there is no distinction between ང་ལ་སྨྱུ་གུ་ཡོད། and
ང་ལ་སྨྱུ་གུ་འདུག. Both mean I have a pen/pen. However, in Tibetan there is a strict
distinction between direct perception and inferential knowledge.
Thus, འདུག is used for direct experience, for something we have just discovered –
whether we are talking about ourselves or somebody else.
