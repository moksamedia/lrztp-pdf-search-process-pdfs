“COMMON KNOWLEDGE” USAGE OF འདུག VERSUS ཡོད་རེད།
When stating common knowledge or a general truth – for example about your own home country
– even if (or because) you have seen it a hundred times, the testimonial form is not used:
ངའི་ ལུང་པ་
ལ་ གངས་རི་
ཡོད་རེད།
My country
in snow mountains
there are.
There are snow mountains in my country.
Extra grammar note - for later reference
There are cases where you do have a direct experience which is also an essential quality of
someone or something. In these situations, the two forms, རེད་ and འདུག are combined:
ཨ་ལས། བཀྲ་ཤིས་ རེད་འདུག
I see, Tashi
it is.
I see, it is Tashi, not Dolma.

སོལ་མ་
Dolma

རེད་མི་འདུག
it is not.

The རེད་ expresses the essential quality of being Tashi, whilst the འདུག expresses the direct
experience of the speaker. Sometimes, in this context, བཞག is used instead of འདུག. The
above two auxiliaries are very similar and almost interchangeable in this context.
ཨ་ལས། ཞི་མི་
I see
cat
I see, it is a cat.

རེད་བཞག
it is.
