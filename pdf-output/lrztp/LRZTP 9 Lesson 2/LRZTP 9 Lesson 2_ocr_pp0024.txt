LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023

Both of these are the འབྲེལ་སྒྲ་ connective particle. They have the same name, the same
function, the same use. It is just that, due to the different suffixes of the preceding word, the
spelling differs.

ཕྲད་རང་དབང་ཅན།

Independent particles

Likewise,

independent expresses

the term

that the spelling of a particle does not vary

regardless of the (gender of the) suffix of the preceding word. For example:

བྲཀ་ཤིས་བོད་པ་མ་རེད།

Tashi is not Tibetan.

aN

Penpa is not Indian.

~

ཕྲེན་པ་རྒྱ་གར་བ་མ་རད།

.

.

Even though the suffixes of the words བོད་པ་ and རྒྱ་གར་བ་ are not the same, the spelling of the
particle remains the same. Bear in mind that particles (almost) always
དགག་སགླ་"སྒྲ" negation
Mes
follow the word they specify or belong to.
The first particle ཕྲད་ introduced in this lesson is the area particle, ay, Its range of different
usages is extremely broad, but for the moment it is enough to understand the following:
e

The ལ་དོན་ particle marks the place, aim, goal or recipient of an action or event.

e

Whilst literary Tibetan makes use of seven different ལ་དཤ་ particles, (རུ, ར', རུ་, ཏུ་,

aN, 5); in colloquial it is mostly the & or %" that are used.

Marking the place (locative function of the ལ་དོན་):

The kid is at school.

The & in this sentence is specifying and clarifying the relationship between the two nouns
(the child and the school). The child is located af school. It is safe to say that the most
common

translations

of the ལ་དོན་ཚ་༠་

“to”, “at”,

“in”, “for”.

It should be borne

in mind,

however, that there are also many other occasions and translations for the ལ་དོན་་

Additional note — for grammar enthusiasts:
Grammatically speaking, the particles, such as ལ་དོན་› indicate which case is used for a
word or phrase. In terms of Latin grammar, the ལ་དོན་ marks the dative or object. Tibetan
