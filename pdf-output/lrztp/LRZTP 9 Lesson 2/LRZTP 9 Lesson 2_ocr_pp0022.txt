LRZTP 9 Module 1 - Lesson 2, May 2023

“COMMON KNOWLEDGE” USAGE OF GRA] VERSUS ཡོད་རེད།
When stating common knowledge or a general truth — for example about your own home country
— even if (or because) you have seen it a hundred times, the testimonial form is not used:

ངའི་

ལང་པ་

ལ་

གངས་རི་

ཡོད་རེད།

My

༠༠111[1¥

in

snow mountains

there are.

There are snow mountains in my country.

Extra grammar note - for later reference
There are cases where you do have a direct experience which is also an essential quality of
someone or something. In these situations, the two forms, རེད་ and འདུག are combined:

ཨ་ལས།

བཀྲ་ཤེས་

རེད་འདུག

སྒོལ་མ་

རེད་མི་འདུག

I see,

Tashi

it 15.

Dolma

it is not.

I see, it is Tashi, not Dolma.
The རེད་ expresses the essential quality of being Tashi, whilst the AHA] expresses the direct
experience of the speaker. Sometimes, in this context, བཞག is used instead of འདུག. The
above two auxiliaries are very similar and almost interchangeable in this context.

I see

cat

it 1S.

I see, it is a cat.
