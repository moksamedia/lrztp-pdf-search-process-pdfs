1 — Lesson 7, June 2023

ང་རྒྱལ་ས་ལ་ཕྱིན་མེད།

I haven't gone to town. / I didn't go to town.
Maybe you have noticed in Lesson 6 that with the negation of པ་ཡིན། and པ་རེད། we (almost)
always use present perfect tense.
ངས་ལྟད་མོ་བལྟས་མེད།

I did not watch a movie.

ཁོང་གིས་རི་འཇེགས་ཡོད་མ་རེད།

(S)he did not climb the mountain.

Direct Versus Inferential
Likewise,

འདུག

and

ཡོད་རེད།,

which

express

direct

immediate

experience

and

inferential

knowledge when used as “to be” or “to have,” carry the exact same meaning when used in
the Present Perfect:

ཁོང་སླེབས་
(S)he has arrived.
This sentence unambiguously expresses: / have the direct experience of him having arrived.
Whereas, if I only know about a result of an action, I choose the inferential auxiliary:

ཁོང་ཚོ་དྭ་ལྟ་ཨ་རེ་ལ་སླེབས་ཡོད་མ་རེད།
They have not reached the U.S. (by) now.
Action or Result:

ཁང་གིས་དེབ་ཡག་པོ་ཅིག་ཉོས་འདུག
(S)he has bought a good book (and I can see it here).

In this sentence, we cannot tell for sure whether the speaker has seen the act of buying or not.
It could be, but it is irrelevant. What the sentence is about is the resu/t of the act of buying.
If they wanted to talk about the act of buying itself, (s)he would say:

ཁོང་གིས་དེབ་ཡག་པོ་ཅིག་ཏོས་སོང་།
(S)he bought a book (and I saw the action).
As mentioned above, since no such distinction of evidence is made in English, this takes a
little time to get used to. Remember that the second sentence would not be correct if you had
not seen the action happen!
