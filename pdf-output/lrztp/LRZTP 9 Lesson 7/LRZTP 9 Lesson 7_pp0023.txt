ཨོ། གངས་མང་པོ་བབས་འདུག
ཨོ། གངས་མང་པོ་བབས་བཞག
(The subtle difference between འདུག and བཞག will be discussed later, for the moment, think
of them as being the same.)

Yes, you see correctly! The auxiliaries of present tense are nothing else than “to have” – and
this is of course not a coincidence. Since it expresses a result, we are saying “I have …” or
“There is …” Since it is more often that we talk about a result which is actually present – and
not one we only know of – direct knowledge is used more often.
The table is self-explanatory, but there are a few interesting things to note:
To Have the Result
First, the term ཡོད། illustrates that one has or is endowed with the result of the past action.
For example:
ངས་ཁ་ལག་བཟོས་ཡོད།
I have made food. (Here I have it / Here it is - the result is still present).

The difference between འདུག and བཞག is not something you should worry about. You can think of them to be
synonyms at the moment. If you can, remember that བཞག་ is only used in positive statement, not in questions and
negations. So you cannot say མི་བཞག or བཞག་གས།
