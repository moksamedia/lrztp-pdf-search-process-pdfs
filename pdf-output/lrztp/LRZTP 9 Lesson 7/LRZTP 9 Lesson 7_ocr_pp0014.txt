PRESENT TENSE

Notions
As mentioned in the previous lesson, there are two present tenses, present tense and present
perfect tense. Both of them will be elaborated on in this lesson. As also explained in Lesson
6, one needs to be aware of two particular features of any verb in Tibetan which are not
distinguished in English. This is also the case in present tense.
a)

When stating something about oneself, one needs to distinguish whether or not the

action is volitional.
b) When talking about someone else, there is a difference between direct and inferential
knowledge.
The following is a list of the present tense auxiliaries which allow you to unambiguously
express these notions.

The Auxiliaries

བདག

གཞན།
Inferential

གི་ཡོད།

གི་ཡོད་རེད།
གི་ཡོད་མ་རེད།

གི་མེད།

Direct

གི་འདུག

I’m sure the above auxiliaries look familiar. They are simply “to be” (in its existential mode)
or “to have’, and their notions are the same.
Two Usages
There are two major usages of the present tense auxiliary:
a)

To express an action which is happening right now. “Right now” can refer to the very
moment of speech as well as to a longer period of time, such as a semester, a year,
etc. For example:

ང་བོད་སྐད་སྦྱོང་གི་ཡོད། “I'm studying/I study Tibetan”
