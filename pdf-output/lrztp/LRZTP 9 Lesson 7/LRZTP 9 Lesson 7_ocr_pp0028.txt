1 — Lesson 7, June 2023

All the students came. (I've heard, I came to know.)

(Simple Past, Inferential)
3.

An action was done without my witnessing it, but I can see its resu/t with my own eyes:
སློབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སླེབས་བཞག

or:

སློབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སླེབས་འདུག

All the students have come. (I did not see them coming but I see them now.)

(Present Perfect, Direct)
4.

I know that someone did something and want to express that I’ve heard about its result:

སློབ་ཕྲུག་ཚང་མ་སླེབས་ཡོད་རེད།
All the students have come. (I did not see them come, but I learned of it.)

(Present Perfect, Inferential)
5.

I see that somebody is doing the action at the moment of speech:

སློབ་ཕུག་ཚང་མ་སྲེབས་ཀི་འདུག
All the students are arriving. (I’m on the spot and see them arrive.)

(Present Tense, Direct)
6.

I only

know that somebody is doing the action now, or does it habitually:

སློབ་ཕུག་ཚང་མ་སླེབས་ཀྱི་ཡོ་ཡོད་རེད།
All the students arrive. (I’m not witnessing their arrival but know of it.)

(Present tense, Inferential)
Additional Note - For Later Reference:
The following two topics relate to the past tense. Because of the amount of new material
involved, they will be explained in detail in later lessons.

&§ is a secondary verb used to ask somebody whether (s)he has “ever done X.” (Lesson 12)

ཁྱེད་རང་བོད་ལ་འགྲོ་རྱོང་ངས།

འགྲོ་མ་རྱོང་།

Have you ever been to Tibet?

No, [ haven't.

The nominalizer རྒྱ་ is used to express “not yet.” (Lesson 18)
ང་དེ་རིང་གི་ཚགས་ པར་ལྟ་རྒྱུ་ཡིན།
I have not yet read today's newspaper.
