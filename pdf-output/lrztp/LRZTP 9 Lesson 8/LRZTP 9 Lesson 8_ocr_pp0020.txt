] — Lesson 8, June 2023

The syllable ais subject to the same spelling rules here as in the present tense and as a agar
Ay (see Lesson 3).

Interesting Points about the Auxiliaries
The future auxiliaries are similar to those of the present and past tense, with a few (logical)
differences:
1.

The future tense does not use the term ཡོད།, because this word indicates that someone

“is endowed” with a particular action or “has” the habit of performing it — neither of
which is the case here.
2.

Unlike in the present tense, in terms of གཞན་: no distinction can be made in the future
tense between direct and inferential knowledge.

An action which is yet to happen

cannot have been witnessed by the speaker.
3.

In its second usage, the auxiliary གི་རེད། is used both for oneself and for others. The
reason for this is that since it is an expression of something/somebody's nature, it
does not matter whom or what we are talking about. Almost needless to say: also in
the future, you will use the auxiliary pertaining to གཞན་ when talking about yourself
using a བྱེད་མེད་ལས་ཚིག་ (non-volitional verb).

Time Frame

In terms of time frame, the span of the future tense is very broad. It ranges from a little while
from now all the way to future lives. For example:

དོ་དགོང་ང་མོག་མོག་ཟ་གི་ཡིན།

འཐེན་ཐུག་འཐུང་གི་མིན།

Tonight I will have momos. I won't have noodle soup. (vol.)

རེས་ལ་ང་ཚས་དེབ་དའི་དན་དག་ཧ་གོ་གི་རེད

Later, we will understand/know the meaning of the text. (non-vol.)

He won't come to class tomorrow. He went to India today.

ཁྱེད་རང་མགྱོགས་པོ་དྲག་གི་རེད།
You will recover soon!

ལོ་རྗེས་མར་ང་ཚོ་ཚང་མ་བོད་ལ་གནས་སྐོར་ལ་འགྲོ་གི་ཡིན།
Next year, we will all go on pilgrimage to Tibet. (vol.)
