༄༅། ། ལོ་ཙཱ་བ་རིན་ཆེན་བཟང་པོའི་སྐད་སྒྱུར་སོབ་གྲྭའི་སོབ་ཚན། །
LRZTP 9 Module 1 – Lesson 8, June 2023
by the auxiliary. There is one further occasion (see Lesson 30) where ཡོང་གོ་ appears at the
end of the sentence without any auxiliary:
སང་ཉིན་ཆར་པ་འབབ་ཡོང་གོ།
I doubt it will rain tomorrow. / I wonder whether it will rain tomorrow.
ཁེད་རང་མགོགས་པོ་དྲག་ཡོང་གོ།
I hope you will recover quickly!
The ཡོང་གོ་ in these sentences carries a sense of doubt or hope and is therefore completely
different from the “volunteering” function introduced above.
Test Yourself at the End of the Lesson:
 Am I able to have various conversations using complete conjugations of verbs in
the past, present and future, around foods in different contexts, such as recipes,
eating out, likes, etc.?
 Am I able to present, for example, weekend or holiday plans, using the future
tense? And can I place an emphasis on the fact that I will do something for
somebody else?
