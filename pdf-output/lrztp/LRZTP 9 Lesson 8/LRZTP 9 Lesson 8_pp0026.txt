LRZTP 9 Module 1 – Lesson 8, June 2023
certain that the action will happen. Be aware that many Tibetans tend to pronounce the ཡག as
a ཡས་. Whereasམཁན་ emphasises the doer / agent of the action rather than the action itself.
So, one could think of “I'm a goer” as being a translation of ང་འགོ་མཁན་ཡིན།. It is safe to
say that, as a future auxiliary, མཁན་ is much less common than གི་ཡིན། and ཡག་ཡིན།. And, since
མཁན་ has many additional functions as indicated in the table below, you should just know of
this usage of it passively at this stage. Please also note that a lot of Tibetans in exile do not
say མཁན་ but ཉན་ (no standardized spelling available), which means the same.
Additional Information for Later Reference:
It is important to understand that the use of ཡག་and མཁན་ as future auxiliaries is only one of
their functions, and not the most common one.
Other Functions of ཡག་ and མཁན་
 ཡག་ and མཁན་ are used as nominalizers. A nominalizer is a syllable added to a verb
which converts the verb into a noun (Lesson 18).


ཡག་ is used to form the infinitive, with various functions, as follows:
བོད་སྐད་སང་ཡག་དེ་ལས་ས་པོ་མི་འདུག
Studying Tibetan (to study Tibetan) is not easy.
ངས་དེབ་ཉོ་ཡག་དྲན་པ་བརེད་སོང་།
I forgot to buy the book.
དེ་རིང་ང་གིང་ག་ལ་འགོ་ཡག་མ་བྱུང་།
Today I didn't get to go to the picnic. (Lesson 32)
དུག་སོག་འཁྲུད་ཡག་དེ་ཚོ་ག་པར་ཡོད་རེད།
Where are the clothes to be washed? (Lesson 18)

 ཡག་ is used to form relative clauses (Lesson 19)
སང་ཉིན་སོང་ཡག་གི་སོབ་ཚན་དེ་ལས་ས་པོ་ཡོད་རེད།
The lesson which we are going to study tomorrow is easy.
 མཁན་ is used as1 a nominalizer (Lesson 18)

Note that this is grammatically speaking the correct form – however, a lot of people say: སྤྲད་མཁན་.
