by the auxiliary. There is one further occasion (see Lesson 30) where ཡོང་གོ་ appears at the

སང་ཉིན་ཆར་པ་འབབ་ཡོང་གོ།
I doubt it will rain tomorrow. / I wonder whether it will rain tomorrow.

I hope you will recover quickly!
The ཡོང་གོ་ in these sentences carries a sense of doubt or hope and is therefore completely
different from the “volunteering” function introduced above.

Test Yourselfat the End of the Lesson:
e

Am I able to have various conversations using complete conjugations of verbs in
the past, present and future, around foods in different contexts,

such as recipes,

eating out, likes, etc.?

@

Am I

able to present, for example, weekend or holiday plans, using the future

tense? And

can I place an emphasis

on the fact that / will do something

somebody else?
