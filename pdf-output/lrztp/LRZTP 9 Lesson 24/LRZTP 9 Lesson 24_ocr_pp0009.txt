The nominalizers gry, ཚུལ། and གྲོལ།
Like the other nominalizers (introduced in Lesson 18), these syllables are added to Present Tense
verbs, turning them into nouns. Though they can all be roughly translated as "the way of doing X,"
they have varying meanings and usages:
1) སྟངས།
The nominalizer སྟངས། is straightforward and literally means the "way,"
which the action of the verb is accomplished.

When

Do you know how to make momoos (lit. the way to make momos)?
The above question could also be expressed as: ཁྱེད་རང་མོག་མོག་བཟོ་ཤེས་ཀྱི་ཡོད་པས། Do you know how
to make momos? However, the use of སྟངས་ makes the question more pointed.

སེམས་ཅན་འདེའི་གོམ་པ་རྒྱག་སྟངས་ཁྱད་མཚར་པོ་འདུག རྐང་པ་ནད་པ་ཡིན་ས་རེད།
This animal walks strangely (lit. the way this animal walks is strange). Perhaps its leg hurts.
