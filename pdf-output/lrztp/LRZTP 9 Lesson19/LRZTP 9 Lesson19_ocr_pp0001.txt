གཟུགས་པོ་འཁྲུས་པ།
Tibetans have a tradition of གྲཟུགས་པོ་འཁུས་པ་ (taking a shower) before the New Year. On the 29"
day of the last Tibetan lunar month, males bathe, and on the 30" it is the ladies of the house. This

custom goes back to the days when New Year was one of the rare occasions for taking a bath!

བོང་གུའི་ཨ་མཆོག
The large hollow pastry that adorns the house shrine for Losar

is called བོང་བུ་(བོང་གུའི་)ཨ་མཆོག (donkey ears).

དགུ་ཐུག་འཐུང་བ།
On the evening of the 29", Tibetan families gather together for དགུ་ཐུག་འཐུང་བ་ (to drink the soup
with the nine ingredients). Not only does this soup actually contain དྭགུ་ (nine) ingredients, it also
has symbols (nowadays mostly on tiny sheets of paper) hidden inside balls of dough.

Each family

member receives one of these hidden symbols. For example:
Rear (wool: soft gentle character), sor (sun: radiant), gray (moon: bright),
ནང་རྐུ་ (thief of the house: long fingers), ARS (wind horse: lucky one)
