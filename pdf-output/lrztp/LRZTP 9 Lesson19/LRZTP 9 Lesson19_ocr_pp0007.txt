Relative clauses
Relative clauses are phrases (within a sentence) which in English contain terms such as "which", "what",
"who", "whom", “that” etc. They can be considered a combination of two short sentences. For example:

I bought a book. It is interesting.

ངས་དེབ་ཅེག་ཏོས་པ་ཡིན།
wp

=

ms,

v

དེ་སྟན་པོ་འདུག

wy

a

Ye

To say the same thing in a single sentence, the two shorter sentences are combined into:

ངས་ཁོས་པའི་དེབ་དེ་སྟན་པོ་འདུག
The book that I bought is interesting.
The phrase “‘that I bought” is an example of a relative clause. We make relative clauses whenever we
wish to specify a further piece of information

about something.

In the above

example,

you are

specifying something about the book you bought.
The structure for relative clauses in Tibetan is different than in English. In English, the sentence
begins with the noun (“The book that...””). In Tibetan, the noun (“the book”) comes a/fer the verb and
its nominalizer: ངས་ཉོས་པའི་དེབ། Occasionally this word order is changed around, and people say: Fay
དེབ་ཉོས་པ་དེ་ In order to make relative clauses in Tibetan, the following nominalizers (introduced in
Lesson 18) are used: A

༨༡ འཛོ 3114 གཿ

a) Relative clauses with the nominalizer མཁན་
Formula:
Object (direct or indirect) + verb + nominalizer (མཁན་) + འབྲེལ་སྒྲ་ + noun
ཁ་ལག་
nes
མཁན་
གྱི་
རོགས་པ་
The friend who makes (the) food...
Be aware that, in colloquial, the འབྲེལ་སྒྲ་ is often dropped:

ཁ་ལག་བཟོ་མཁན་རོགས་པ།
