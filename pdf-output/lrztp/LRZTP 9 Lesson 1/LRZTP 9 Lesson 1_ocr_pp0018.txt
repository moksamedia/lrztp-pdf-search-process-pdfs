Note: some rows in the above table have been omitted because none of their consonants have
an attached w.

It is useful to keep the same order, though, because it helps you to remember the correct
pronunciation.
The 1“ row in the above table is straightforward: the sounds of the letters remain the same,
with just a ay added: ay is pronounced: kya, J is pronounced: khya, Yy is pronounced: ghya.
The sounds of the 2" row in the above table «, 3, 3’, རྒྱ) become different, however.
They no longer have the sound of the main letter, ange, namely 47,2",57,6r. Instead, they
take on the sounds of the actua/ second row of the alphabet, namely SBR
xy’

becomes ©' (sound)
becomes &" (sound)
becomes &' (sound)
becomes ཤ་ (sound)

Rule:

Main letters, མིང་གཞི་
which have an attached letter, འདོགས་ཅན་

may also come in combination with any of the following:

head letters, མགོ་ཅན་་
vowel, ད་བངས་:

prefixes, སྔོན་འཇུག་

suffixes, རྗེས་འཇུག་.
