In terms of pronunciation, it is difficult to express these sounds by means of the English
alphabet. It is best just to train with native speakers.
One could say that the sounds of the three columns are quite like “tra”, “thra” (aspirated,
not the English “th” sound) and “dra”, respectively. The letter ཧྲ་ almost has a bit of a “sh”
sound. Examples of ར་བཏགས་:
སྐྲ་:
hair
གློགས་མློ་:
female friend
ངློ་སློད་བེད་པ་:
to introduce

Column 1

Column 2

Column 3

ཀླ་

Column 4

ག་
བ་
ཟླ་

རླ་

ས་

These are all pronounced with a high tone ལ་ sound, except for the ཟླ་: This letter
combination is an exception and is pronounced da. For example: ཟླ་བ་ is pronounced dawa
(moon, month, name of a person). Examples of ལ་བཏགས་:
ཀླད་པ་:
brain
གློག་བརྙན་: movie, film
རླུང་:
wind, air
Exceptions:
བ་: When combined with a prefix ད་ OR when appearing as the second or third syllable
of a word, it is pronounced (ཝ་) wa. For example:
དབང་
wang:
empowerment
ཨ་རི་བ་
Ariwa:
American
རྒྱ་གར་བ་
Gyagarwa: Indian
ཟླ་བ་
Dawa
Dawa, moon, month
When: བ་ is the first syllable of a word or a suffix, then it is pronounced ba. For example:
བུ་མློ་:
bumo
girl
བ་ཕྱུགས་:
bachug
cow
བག་ལེབ་:
bagleb
bread
࿉ 20 ࿉
