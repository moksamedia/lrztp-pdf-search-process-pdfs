Importance of correct spelling:
Even though you are only in Lesson 1, you have already seen three words which sound
quite similar:
གློ་
to hear
མགློ་
head
སློ་
door
You will soon be meeting a few more:
འགློ་བཙུགས་
to start
དགློས་
to must, want, need, have to
Thus you can see that correct spelling in Tibetan is important for correct pronunciation.
