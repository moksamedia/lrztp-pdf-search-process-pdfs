THE THREE HEAD (SUPERSCRIBED) LETTERS, མགོ་ཅན་གསུམ།
Three of the thirty consonants, གསལ་བྱེད་ can appear at the head, མགོ་ཅན་ of the main letter,

མིང་གཞི་. The word མགོ་ means head. These three letters are 4, a and x. When superscribed
in this way, they are called: ར་མགོ་, ལ་མགོ་ and ས་མགོ་
As for the sound, head letters, མགོ་ཅན་ are silent like the prefixes, སྔོན་འཇུག་ and have the
same effect on the letters (of the first five rows) of the 3“ and 4" column. They thus remove
the aspiration from column 3 and convert the letters of column 4 to high tone. For example:
ང་

(low tone):

I, me

ལྔ་

(high tone):

five

ན་

(low tone):

to be sick

.

(high tone):

ear

གོ་

(slightly aspirated):

to hear

(non aspirated):

door

head-letters:
