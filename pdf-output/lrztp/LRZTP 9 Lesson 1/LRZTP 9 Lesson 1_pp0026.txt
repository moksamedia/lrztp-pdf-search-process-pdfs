Test Yourself at the End of this Lesson:
• Am I able to ask & answer name, country of origin, state of well-being and
destination in different registers of politeness?
• Am I able to analyze the sounds of certain syllables, which I mispronounced?
• Am I able to experience, recall and share a moment of realizing that I can do
something which seemed impossible two weeks ago?

i (H) stands for 'Honorific' - a language register used for others to express one's respect towards them. (h), which is
not very common, stands for 'humilific' - a language register mostly used for oneself to express one's humbleness.
ii Saying "dhü" here is not Wylie, but a type of phonetic - to remind you that the 3rd column letter ད་ is slightly
aspirated when it has neither head letter nor prefix.
