Pronunciation rule for letters of the 3rd column
A main letter of the 3rd column loses its aspiration when it has a prefix, སྔློན་འཇུག་ or a
head letter, མགློ་ཅན་.
(This rule only applies for the first five rows of the alphabet.)
Prefixes, སྔློན་འཇུག་ also affect the sound of the 4th column (very female letters) ང་, ཉ་, ན་, མ་
and the female letter ཡ་.
Pronunciation rule for letters of the 4th column
A main letter of the 4th column which takes a prefix, སྔློན་འཇུག་ or a head-letter changes
from low to high tone:
(This rule also applies only for the first five rows of the alphabet.)
For example:
ཡར་ (low tone):
ནང་ (low tone):
ཉལ་ (low tone):

upwards
house, home
to sleep

གཡག་ (high tone): yak
གནང་ (high tone) : to do (H)
གཉིས་ (high tone): two

Pronunciation rule for letters of the 1st and 2nd columns
If a prefix, སྔློན་འཇུག་ precedes a letter of the 1st or 2nd column, i.e. the male and neutral
letters, the sound of the main letter, མིང་གཞི་ is unaffected.
Examples for 1st and 2nd columns:
• བཀའ་མློལ་: speech (H) Main letter, མིང་གཞི་ “ཀ་” is from 1st column. This ཀ་ is
pronounced in exactly the same way as in the word ཀ་བ་ (pillar), where it does not
have any prefix.
• ནམ་མཁའ་: sky. Main letter, མིང་གཞི་ “ཁ་” is from 2nd column (neutral letters). The ཁ་ in
this word is pronounced in exactly the same way as in the word ཁ་ (mouth), where it
does not have any prefix.
• མཚོ་: lake. Main letter, མིང་གཞི་ “ཚོ་” is from 2nd column (neutral letters). This letter ཚོ་
sounds exactly the same as in the syllable ཚོ་ (plural marker) In summary, it seems
that only female and very female letters are affected by the prefixes, སྔློན་འཇུག
As stated previously, the prefixes, སྔློན་འཇུག་ are mostly silent. There are a few exceptions
where they are pronounced. For example:
• བློ་བཟང་: sometimes pronounced “Lobsang” rather than “Losang”
• ཨ་མདློ་: pronounced “Amdo” rather than “Ado” (an Eastern province of Tibet).
