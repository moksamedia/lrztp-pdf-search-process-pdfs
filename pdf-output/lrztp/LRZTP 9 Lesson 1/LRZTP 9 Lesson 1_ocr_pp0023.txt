The above line may sound strange and like a riddle or word play. However, it is actually a
commonly used sounding-aloud spelling system.
Becoming quick in this skill is not only fun but also extremely useful. Perhaps you have
already heard native speakers doing it. Whenever there seems to be slight confusion about
whether the person addressed understands the term correctly, (educated) Tibetans will spell
out the word.
Because

the syllables are more

complex

than in other languages,

the Tibetans have

developed a special system. It is actually quite similar to Wylie. They also go letter by letter
through the syllable, starting from the prefix, then head letters if any, then main letter, etc.

The sounding rules:
Only one letter
Main letter is sounded with its inherent “‘a’’.

J

fish

“nya”

=

tea

པབ 3)

ལ་

mountain pass

“la”

Main letter + vowel
Main letter is sounded with its inherent “ta” and then the name of the vowel.

J

boy

“bu-shubkyu

bu”

ཏོ་

to buy

“nya-naro

ཆུ་

water

“chha-shabkyu

nyo”
chu”

Main letter + suffix
Each letter is sounded separately (with inherent “a’”) and then they are sounded together. (If
there is a vowel, the inherent “a” sound of the main letter is in the end replaced by the sound
of the vowel.)
