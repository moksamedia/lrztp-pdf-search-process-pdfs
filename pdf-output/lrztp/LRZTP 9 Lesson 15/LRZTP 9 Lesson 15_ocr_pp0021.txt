LRZTP 9 Module 2 — Lesson 15, September 2023

The auxiliaries of probability or modal verbs
Introduction
English language makes use of the moda/ verbs “can, could, may, might, must, shall, should,

will and would” to express that we believe something is certain, probable and possible.
Tibetan language uses certain syllables at the end of the sentence rather than actual verbs to
express such a mode of the verb.
Frequency
The Tibetan language makes use of a wide range of modals in order to express probability. In
this lesson, the four most common ones will be introduced. Their frequent usage might have
something to do with Buddhist philosophy which emphasises the uncertain and transient
nature of everything.
Translation
These auxiliaries of probability are translated into English as the modal verbs introduced
above and/or adverbs such as “maybe”,

“perhaps”,

“probably”,

“most probably”, etc.

Auxiliaries or Modals
It remains an open question and up to you to decide whether you’d like to perceive them as
“auxiliaries” or just ““modals” which are attached to the auxiliaries of the three times.

a)

Auxiliaries

The first way to perceive the modals of probability is to see them as the actua/ auxiliary
(including the indication of tense and of probability), which is then directly added to the
main verb. For example:

སྲེན་པ་ལགས་

བོད་ལ་

aay

ཡག་ཡིན་ས་རེད།

Penpa-la

to Tibet

full verb

future aux. of probability

b) Modals
