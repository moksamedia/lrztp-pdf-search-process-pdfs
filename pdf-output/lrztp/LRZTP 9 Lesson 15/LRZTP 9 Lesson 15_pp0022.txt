LRZTP 9 Module 2 – Lesson 15, September 2023
The second way to perceive them is to see them (ས་རེད།, པ་འདྲ།, གི་རེད། & འགོའོ།) as separate modal
syllables indicating probability which you add to the conjugated verbs. In order to do so correctly,
just take the བདག conjugation of each tense and add these syllables at the end. For example:
སེན་པ་ལགས་ བོད་ལ་
འགོ་ཡག་ཡིན་
ས་རེད།
Penpa-la
to Tibet བདག future tense probability syllable.
At the end of the lesson, you will find a full table of the three times with both of these
versions for your reference.
Emphasis on the speaker’s perspective
As you surely noticed, only those auxiliaries that pertain to བདག (ie. ཡིན་, མིན་, ཡོད་, མེད་)
precede the models of probability – or are used to form the modals. They express clearly the
perspective and opinion of the speaker.
Likelihood
Opinions vary (and contradict one another) on which modals in Tibetan express more or less
likelihood. It is not realistic to want to come up with a scale of percentage, etc. rather than
that, one needs to be aware of the presence or absence of evidence.
Distinction in terms of evidence
There is a clear distinction in terms of evidence. The auxiliaries ས་རེད། and པ་འདྲ། are only
used based on direct evidence. This distinction is actually similar to the one in English where
we use “must” for something we are either sure of or have a valid reason to believe to be the
case. So, for example, if one sees a pair of shoes in front of the door, one will say:
བློ་བཟང་སེབས་ཡོད་ས་རེད།
not: བློ་བཟང་སེབས་ཡོད་འགོའ།ོ
Lobsang must have arrived.
Because the shoes are the evidence, based on which one then expresses one’s guess, the
sentence བློ་བཟང་སེབས་ཡོད་འགོའ།ོ would be used if one had no evidence whatsoever and were
merely guessing.
