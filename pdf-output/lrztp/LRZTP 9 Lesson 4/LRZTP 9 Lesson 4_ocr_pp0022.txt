we / us by exam there is
We have an exam/exams. (Talking generally)
Answering the question: “What do we have?”
TO CONCLUDE

Apart from the ones above, there seem to be no firm rules about using “the” and “a” when they are
not explicitly mentioned in the Tibetan sentence.
It is often rather a question of aesthetic and personal preference than accuracy to put a གཅིག or
not. There is nothing to worry about at this stage of your learning process!

One more subtlety... which is only mentioned to avoid confusion:
There is one more use of གཅིག་ which is an extremely typical Tibetan way of expression but
due to its lack of rule about when to apply it, is hard to actively use.

As you see, the translation of it vary. What they all have in common is that they express a
short time, or something not so important.
QUESTION PARTICLES
There are no question marks in Tibetan. Instead, a question particle is used. As in literary/classical
Tibetan, this particle goes at the end of the sentence. There are three such particles: EAN, གས།, SAI.
Their usage depends on the རྗེས་འཇུག (suffix) of the preceding word.
