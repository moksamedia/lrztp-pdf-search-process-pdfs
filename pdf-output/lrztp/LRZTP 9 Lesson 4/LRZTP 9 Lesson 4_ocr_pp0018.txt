THE NEGATION PARTICLE ད་གག་སྒྲ་: 2, ar
In General

As shown by the examples in this and the previous lessons, Tibetan makes use of a negation particle
དགག་སྒྲ་ in order to negate the verb. I believe you are already familiar with their use and position.
According to Tibetan grammar, མིན། and མེད། which pertain to བདག: are not considered དགག་སྒྲ་.

With a Noun or Adjective
The negation particles དགག་སྒྲ་ are also used to form the negation or opposite of a noun or adjective:
oN

oN

རེག་པ་དང་མ་རེག་པ་
intelligence ignorance, stupidity (noun)
རྟག་པ་དང་མི་ རྟག་པ་

permanent impermanent (adjective)
Be careful not to mistake the word &' (person) for a དགག་སྒྲ་. You will be able to tell the difference
from the context.
With Auxiliaries

The usage of the དགག་སྒྲ་ in the context of the auxiliaries will be introduced in Lesson Five. Its
position in the sentence and whether a or & is used will vary from tense to tense, but is very
simple and logical.
