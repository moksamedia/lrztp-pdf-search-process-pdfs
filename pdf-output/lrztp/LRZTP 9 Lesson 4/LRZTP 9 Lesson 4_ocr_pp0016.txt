““Subject-object-verb” position holders thus would say that this is the common word order. The
“context”

position holders

would

say that ‘fa nice

place”

(ལུང་པ་སྐྱིད་པོ་ཅིག་(ཞེག))

answers

the

question “ Whatis India” or “Howis India?”

So, if the word order changes to:

ཁུང་པྲ་ཀུད་པ་གཅག་རྒྱ་བར་རད།
v

ny

te

NS

v

v

=>

nice country a India is
A nice country is India.
““Subject-object-verb” position holders would say that “India” (རྒྱ་གར་) is now emphasized as it is
an unusual word order. And the “context” position holders would point out that rather than an
emphasis, “India” (རྒྱ་གར་) is just the answer to the question: “ What 18 a nice country ?”, which is a
different question or context from the one above.
To Conclude:
Saying that “whatever stands next to the verb is crucial” can either be seen as: 1) a means to
deliberately emphasize

a word;

or 2) it can be perceived as simply being the answer to a

different question.
Below you find a few examples to get used to these two notions:

རྒྱ་གར་ལ་ ཆོས་ལུགས་ མང་པོ་ ཡོད་རེད།
India in religious traditions many there are
There are many religious traditions in India.
Likewise one can see this as “common” word order or the answer to the question: “ What is
there in India?”

Tashi India in is not
Tashi is not in India.
Either see this as “common” word order or the answer to ‘‘ Where is Tashi?”

མཆོད་རྟེན་མང་པོ་བལ་ཡུལ་ལ་ ཡང་ ཡོད་རེད།
stupas many Nepal also there are
