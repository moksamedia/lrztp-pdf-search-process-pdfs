Where is the stupa?

Lesson 12
1.

Using the postpositions you will be able to precisely describe the position of items
and individuals in a picture, room or in your surroundings and ask for as well as give,
simple directions about places to go, such as your home, school, the library, etc.

2.

By using the five most common verbalizers - including the non-volitional one - you
will gain an insight into this peculiar aspect of the Tibetan language which does not
have a direct equivalent in English (or your own mother language).

DID YOU KNOW ...
...why the great stupa in
Boudhanath (Nepal) is called

མཆོད་རྟེན་ = stupa

བྱ་རུང་ = “it's fine for you to make”

ཁ་ཤོར་ = slipped from mouth
Traditional accounts hold that permission was given
to build a stupa on a place as large as the size of a
buffalo skin. However, the person requesting
this construction then cut the buffalo skin into a thread, marking an enormous circle on

which མཆོང་'རྡེན་བྱ་རང་ཁ་ཤོར་ (Boudhnath stupa) was built.
