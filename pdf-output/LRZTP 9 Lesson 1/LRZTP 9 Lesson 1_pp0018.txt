THE FOUR ATTACHED (SUBSCRIBED) LETTERS འདློགས་ཅན་བཞི།
a) The Seven Attached ཡ་ Letters ཡ་བཏགས་ བདུན་།
Column 1

Column 2

Column 3

Column 4

ཀ་
པྱ་

ཁ་

ག་
བ་

མ་

ཕྱ་

Note: some rows in the above table have been omitted because none of their consonants have
an attached ཡ་.
It is useful to keep the same order, though, because it helps you to remember the correct
pronunciation.
The 1st row in the above table is straightforward: the sounds of the letters remain the same,
with just a ཡ་ added: ཀ་ is pronounced: kya, ཁ་ is pronounced: khya, ག་ is pronounced: ghya.
The sounds of the 2nd row in the above table (པྱ་, ཕྱ་, བ་, མ་) become different, however.
They no longer have the sound of the main letter, མིང་གཞི་, namely པ་,ཕ་,བ་,མ་. Instead, they
take on the sounds of the actual second row of the alphabet, namely ཅ་,ཆ་,ཇ་,ཉ་:
པྱ་ becomes ཅ་ (sound)
ཕྱ་ becomes ཆ་ (sound)
བ་ becomes ཇ་ (sound)
མ་ becomes ཉ་ (sound)
Rule:
Main letters, མིང་གཞི་
which have an attached letter, འདློགས་ཅན་
may also come in combination with any of the following:
head letters, མགློ་ཅན་,
vowel, དབངས་,
prefixes, སྔློན་འཇུག་,
suffixes, རེས་འཇུག་.
