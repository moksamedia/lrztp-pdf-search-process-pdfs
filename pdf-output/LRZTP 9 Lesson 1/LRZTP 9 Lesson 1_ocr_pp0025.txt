Punctuation
Since this is a colloquial textbook, only the main rules of punctuation are briefly introduced
here. These are not the same rules as used in literary Tibetan, where there are also particular
particles used for punctuation.
The purpose of writing these simple rules here is for the student to know where to stop
and raise or lower one’s voice.

Punctuation Symbols
There is the inter-syllabic point * (ཚེག་), the perpendicular stroke
double stroke: །། (N95).

(ཤད་ or ཆིག་ཤད་) and the

As the name tells, the aay is placed between two syllables and

also words as there is no space between them.
A ཤད་ marks the end of a phrase or sentence and the ཉིས་ཤད་ is placed at the end of a
verse. Before the ཤད་› there is no aay needed. For example:
¬

aN

བྲཀ་ཤས་བད་ལགས།

ཁད་རང་སུ་གཟུགས་བདེ་པོ་ཡིན་པས།
གལ་ཏེ་བཅོས་སུ་ཡོད་ན་ནི།
༨

NZS

་རང་སྐ་གཟུགས་བང་པོ་ཡན་པས

ད་ལ་མ་དགར་ཅ་ཞག་ཡོད།།

Hello!
How are you?

If it can be solved, / why worry?

Exceptions
There are two exceptions to the above rule:
1.

When the last letter of a phrase or sentence is a plain letter ay no ཤད་ is used. For
example:
ཁྱེད་རང་ག་རེ་འཐུང་ག = What are you going to drink?
The rule does not apply when the ay has a vowel or subscribed letter. For example:

གཟིམ་འཇགས་གནང་གོ། = Good night
སློབ་གྲྭ། = School
2.

The second exception is the letter 5’. When it stays alone at the end of a phrase or
sentence, there is a aay placed before the ཤད་. For example:

སྐྱིད་པོ་བྱུང་ང་། = It was fun, wasn’t it?
ཧ་གོ་སོང་ང་། = You understood, right?
It is said that if the ཤད་ was directly attached to the & it might look like the letter 4
Judge yourself: ང།

... This probably depends on one’s handwriting skills...
