THE TWO TYPES OF TIBETAN WORDS

Before considering the technical details of the Tibetan script system, it may be helpful to
share a little insight into the philosophy of Tibetan words. Some people consider Tibetan to
be a “cute” language.

The reason for this is that a considerable number

of words have

meanings that have not been given randomly. For example:
གནམ་གླུ་

“sky ship” is an airplane

རྐང་འཁོར་

“leg wheel” is a bicycle

གློག་ཀླད་

“electric brain” is a computer

ཤ་ཁྲ་སྐེ་རིང་།

°° short form of deer, colorful, neck-long” is a giraffe.

Names such as these, which are given to things for a particular reason, are called རྗེས་གྲབ་,

which means “consequently given.”
Names

which are randomly

given, however,

such as &’ for water, are called འདོད་རྒྱལ',

meaning “‘king of (one’s) wishes.”

THE PARTS OF A SYLLABLE
Every syllable within a Tibetan word consists of up to seven letters. These can have any of
the functions shown in the graphic below:

4. a

1. Ce

8. Superscribed

3. a

Most of these letters should look familiar to you. Only the attached (1.e. subscribed) letter,
the 3“ function, looks different from the way it would appear in the alphabet. Here, it is an
attached =, which is called a ར་བཏགས།

As an aside, the word in the graphic consists of two syllables, separated by a ཚེག. It means
show or exhibition. To find your way in this linguistic jungle, let’s now examine each of the
parts of the two syllables in the graphic, together with their functions:
