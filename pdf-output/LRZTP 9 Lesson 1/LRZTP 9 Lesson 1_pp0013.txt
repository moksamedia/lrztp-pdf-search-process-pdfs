THE TEN SUFFIXES AND TWO SECOND SUFFIXES རེས་འཇུག་བཅུ་དང་། ཡང་འཇུག་གཉིས།
a)
The ten suffixes, རེས་འཇུག་བཅུ་
Ten of the thirty vowels, གསལ་བེད་ can take the role of a suffix, རེས་འཇུག་, namely a letter
following the main letter.་These ten are:
Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
Column 4
ག
ང
ད
ན
བ
མ
འ
ར
ལ
ས
An interesting thought for those who prefer philosophy to mere rules: All suffixes, རེས་འཇུག་
are either female, very female or barren! The ten suffixes, རེས་འཇུག་ follow after any of the
main letters, མིང་གཞི་ and are pronounced without their inherent “a” sound. For example:
ལག་པ་ (pronounced lag pa): hand
ལེན་པ་ (len pa): to take
ནང་པ་ (pronounced nang pa): buddhist
ཁབ་ (khab): needle
ཡིན་ ( pronounced: yin): am
ཁམ་བུ་ (kham bu): peach
There is no need to memorize these suffixes, རེས་འཇུག་, as you will become accustomed to
them by seeing and hearing them in every word that you read, say and write!
Effect of the ten suffixes on pronunciation
The following rules are extremely important for correct pronunciation:
ད་ and ས་
The རེས་འཇུག་ (suffixes) ད་ and ས་ are mute but give an “umlaut” sound to two of the vowels,
དབངས་, namely the “o” and “u”. (Note: in this context, according to Tibetan thinking, the
inherent “a” sound does not count as a vowel, and neither do the two letters འ་and ཨ་.)
For non-German-speakers, “umlaut” means the following: (inherent) “a” becomes ä, so
that ངས་ is pronounced ngä (by me).
ན་རློ་ “o” becomes ö, so that གནློད་པ་ becomes nö pa (harm).
ཞབས་ཀྱུ་ “u” becomes ü, so that དུས་ becomes dhüii (time).
