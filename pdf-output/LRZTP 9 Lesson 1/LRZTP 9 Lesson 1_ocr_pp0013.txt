An interesting thought for those who prefer philosophy to mere rules: All suffixes, EN ART
are either female, very female or barren! The ten suffixes, རྗེས་འཇུག་ follow after any of the
main letters, མིང་གཞི་ and are pronounced without their inherent “fa” sound. For example:
ལག་པ་

(pronounced /ag pa): hand

ལེན་པ་

(Jen pa): to take

ནང་པ་

(pronounced nang pa): buddhist

ཁྲགས

(khab): needle

ཡིན་

( pronounced: yin): am

Rerq’

(kham bu): peach

There is no need to memorize these suffixes, རྗེས་འཇུག, as you will become

accustomed to

them by seeing and hearing them in every word that you read, say and write!

Effect of the ten suffixes on pronunciation
The following rules are extremely important for correct pronunciation:
"and ay”
The རྗེས་འཇུག་ (suffixes) ད་ and ay are mute but give an “umlaut” sound to two of the vowels,

དྭབངས་: namely the “o” and “uw”. (Note: in this context, according to Tibetan thinking, the
inherent “a” sound does not count as a vowel, and neither do the two letters Q’and wa.)

For non-German-speakers, “umlaut” means the following: (inherent) “a” becomes
that cay is pronounced nga (by me).

ན་རོ་ “9” becomes 6, so that གནོད་པ་ becomes /7@ pa (harm).
naray

ཞབས་ཅུ

“u’” becomes vi, so that

66,199

ཧུGay becomes dhif’ (time).
