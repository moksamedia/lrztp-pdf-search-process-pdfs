When there is a combination of prefix དྭ main letter q’ + vowel or subscribed letter,

only the vowel and/or subscribed letter are pronounced. For example:

དབྱིན་ཇི་

inji

foreigner (lit. British)

ARN AGRA

Jamyang

sweet sound, Manjushri

The 43%" does not affect the sound of the main letter, མིང་གཞི་ in any way. Why is it there,
then? In some cases it helps to indicate which is the main letter, མིང་གཞི་ or to distinguish two
words with same sound but different meaning. For example:
དངས་ This syllable has two possibilities of pronunciation:
RW

ད་

is the prefix སྔོན་འཇུག་

=

is the main letter མིང་གཞི་

a

is the suffix རྗེས་འཇུག་

In this case, it would be pronounced nga.
OR: aR

ད་ is the main letter མིང་གཞི་

ཇང is the suffix རྗེས་འཇུག་
my" 18 the second suffix ཡང་འཇུག་

In this case, it is pronounced dang— (the correct pronunciation)
Thus, 111 order to recognize the main letter ain

within a syllable,

a 43%" is added. Now

there is no more ambiguity about which is the main letter: དྭངས་. Here are some examples of
two words with the same sound where the presence of a 473%" changes the meaning:
ag: Tass

S ": vein, channel

&: salt

&': heat

gs: calf (of the leg)

3: fish
