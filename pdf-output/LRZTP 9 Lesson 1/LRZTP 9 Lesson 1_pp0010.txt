THE TWO TYPES OF TIBETAN WORDS
Before considering the technical details of the Tibetan script system, it may be helpful to
share a little insight into the philosophy of Tibetan words. Some people consider Tibetan to
be a “cute” language. The reason for this is that a considerable number of words have
meanings that have not been given randomly. For example:
གནམ་གྲུ་
“sky ship” is an airplane
རྐང་འཁློར་
“leg wheel” is a bicycle
གློག་ཀླད་
“electric brain” is a computer
ཤྭ་ཁ་སེ་རིང་།

“ short form of deer, colorful, neck-long” is a giraffe.

Names such as these, which are given to things for a particular reason, are called རེས་གྲུབ་,
which means “consequently given.”
Names which are randomly given, however, such as ཆུ་ for water, are called འདློད་རྒྱལ་,
meaning “king of (one’s) wishes.”
THE PARTS OF A SYLLABLE
Every syllable within a Tibetan word consists of up to seven letters. These can have any of
the functions shown in the graphic below:

Most of these letters should look familiar to you. Only the attached (i.e. subscribed) letter,
the 3rd function, looks different from the way it would appear in the alphabet. Here, it is an
attached ར་, which is called a ར་བཏགས།
As an aside, the word in the graphic consists of two syllables, separated by a ཚེག. It means
show or exhibition. To find your way in this linguistic jungle, let’s now examine each of the
parts of the two syllables in the graphic, together with their functions:
