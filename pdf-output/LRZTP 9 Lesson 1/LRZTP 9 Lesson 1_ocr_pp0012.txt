Pronunciation rule for letters of the 3" column
A main letter of the 3rd column loses its aspiration when it has a prefix, སྔོན་འཇུག་ or a
head letter, མགོ་ཅན་་

(This rule only applies for the first five rows of the alphabet. )
Prefixes, སྔོན་འཇུག་ also affect the sound of the 4" column (very female 1©{{618) རང, FJ; ན་, ar
and the female letter ay.

Pronunciation rule for letters of the 4* column
A main letter of the 4th column which takes a prefix, སྔོན་འཇུག་ or a head-letter changes

from /ow to figh tone:
(This rule also applies only for the first five rows of the alphabet.)
For example:
wx"

(low tone):

upwards

གཡག་

(high tone): yak

ནང་

(low tone):

house, home

གནང་

(high tone) : to do (11)

ou

(low tone):

to sleep

གཉིས *'

(high tone): two

Pronunciation rule for letters of the 1*and 2™ columns
If a prefix, སྔོན་འཇུག་ precedes a letter of the 1* or 2“ column, i.e. the male and neutral
letters, the sound of the main letter, མིང་གཞི་ is unaffected.

Examples for 1” and 2" columns:
e

བཀའ་མོལ་:

speech

(11) Main

letter, མིང་གཞི་

“ay”

is from

1* column.

pronounced in exactly the same way as in the word ཀ་བ་ (pillar), where it does not
have any prefix.

e

ནམ་མཁའ་་ sky. Main letter, མིང་གཞི་ “ma” is from 2™ column (neutral letters). The (༼བ" in
this word is pronounced in exactly the same way as in the word j@ (mouth), where it
does not have any prefix.

©

a%: lake. Main letter, མིང་གཞི་ “¥” is from 2" column (neutral letters). This letter ¥
sounds exactly the same as in the syllable & (plural marker) In summary, it seems
that only female and very female letters are affected by the prefixes, སྔོན་འཇུག

As stated previously, the prefixes, སྔོན་འཇུག་ are mostly silent. There are a few exceptions
where they are pronounced. For example:
e

ཐོ་བཟང་: sometimes pronounced “Lobsang” rather than “Losang”

@

ཤ་^ཧོ་ pronounced “Amdo” rather than “Ado”
