Lesson 5 Going for a Cup of Tea

Objectives
1) You will be able to have a simple “tea-chat” conversation, accepting and/or refusing tea while talking about
your larger family situation.
2) You will know the concept behind conjugation by exploring the “auxiliaries” and how they relate to “བདག་
and གཞན་” & “to be” and “to have” in the three times. Furthermore, you will get familiar with the peculiar Tibetan
conjugation notions, such as volition of verbs, ཐ་དད་པ་ and ཐ་མི་དད་པ་, the use of an “agentive particle,” etc.
3) You will enjoy the “games” which are played in the context of tea-chats by knowing, happily participating and
appreciating them as a cultural expression.

DID YOU KNOW THAT...?!

ཇ་མང་པོ་འཐུངས་ན་ཨ་མཆོག་སྐམ་གི་རེད།
… if you drink too much
tea, your ears will dry out!
This traditional saying is a
skilful means – or a little white lie – of mothers in the past.
They would say this to their kids so that
they would not want to drink too much tea,
since its ingredients, tea, butter, milk, etc. were expensive.

གཡག་གི་ཕྱུ་ར་

…that yak cheese does not exist?
“Yak” is the male animal and the milk for the cheese, therefore, comes from the female
animal, which is the འབི་.
