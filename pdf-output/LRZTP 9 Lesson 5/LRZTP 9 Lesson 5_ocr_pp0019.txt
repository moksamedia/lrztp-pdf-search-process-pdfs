བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་དད་པ་དང་།
བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་མི་དད་པ།
All Tibetan verbs may be classified within two categories, namely 5° བྱེད་ ཐ་དད་པ་ and 3 བྱེད་ gay དད་པ་ It is a common mistake
to equate these with transitive and intransitive verbs in English. Although in most cases 3) བྱེད་ ཐ་དད་པ་ verbs are transitive and
བྱ་ བྱེད་ gay དད་པ་ verbs are intransitive, the concepts behind the classifications differ.
In English, the definition of a transitive verb is that it has a direct (accusative) object.

In Tibetan, a verb is བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་དད་པ་ (lit. separate) when the agent - who is endowed with volition - and the action are separate
from each other.
For example: ཟླ་བ, the verb “to eat”, is བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་དད་པ་ because the agent and the object being eaten are two different entities. In
the case of this verb, the definitions overlap because in English, likewise, the verb “to eat” is transitive:
English:

I eat an apple
“T° is the subject; “apple” is the direct (accusative) object.

Tibetan:
ཟེ

བུ

& is the agent (བྱེད་པ་པོ་); ཀུ་ཤུ་ is the object (wer)

However, since there are a few interesting cases where the two definitions do not overlap, it is important to become familiar
with the Tibetan concept of བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་དད་པ་ 6116 བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་མི་དད་པ་. Understanding this is crucial to choosing the correct auxiliary.

The verb “to get, obtain, receive” in English is transitive. However, its Tibetan translation རག་པ་ 18 བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་མི་དད་པ་༧༡6 the
sentence structure and auxiliary are therefore different. According to the Tibetan understanding, the action of getting happens

fo

the person and is therefore not separate. The verb “to get” is therefore བྱ་བྱེད་ཐ་མི་དད་པ་.
For example:

~

me

ལ་
to

ལས་ཀ་
work

“ay
get

གི་འདུག

(pres. auxiliary)

I get work.
This nuance is clearly indicated by the usage of the particle 1. This particular particle shows that the action of “getting”
happens to me. The “I” is the recipient of the action, or the place upon which the action happens.
Another case where the classifications differ between English and Tibetan is with verbs such as ཤེས་པ་ “to know,” མཁོང་བ་ “to
see,” and གོ་བ་ “to hear.” In English these are transitive verbs, but according to the Tibetan definition they are ཐ་མི་དད་པ།.
As explained above, this is the case because from the Tibetan perspective, there is no agent endowed with volition involved.
The “knowing,” “seeing” and “hearing” are the result of “watching,” “listening” and “studying” respectively.
For example:
ངས་
