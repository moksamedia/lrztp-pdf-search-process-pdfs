LRZTP 9 Module 1 — Lesson 5, May-June 2023

For example:
To write = Aar(past)

az (present)

(future)

To eat = Qa

= (present)

Qa (future)

Aga (present)

Ags (future)

(past)

To drink = AgRar(past)

More than half of all verbs use the same form for all three tenses:

To see =

མཐོང་

(past)

aigic’

(present/future)

A Very Important Side Note — For Later Reference
You also need to be aware that there is often a slight discrepancy between what the rule dictates and what people
actually say.
For example:
to send

བཏང་

(past)

གཏོང་

(present)

to go =

ཕྱིན་

(past)

aay

(present/future)

to make =

བརྒྱབ་ (past)

to stay, live =

བརླད་

(past)

to give =

སྤད་

(past)

to learn =

སྦྱངས་ (past)

རྒྱག་
སྡོད་

aH

(future)

(present)

བརྒྱབ་

nat

(future)

(present)

(future)

སྤྲོད་པ་ (present/future)

སྦྱོང་བ་ (present)

སྦྱང་ (future)

People very commonly use HR", NSA, NSA), སྤྲད་ and སྦྱང་ for the present/future tense and aay for the past tense.

And for reasons of accuracy it needs to be mentioned here also that in /#terary Tibetan, the present and future form of
the verb are not always the same.
For example: “to write” Qa'oV is present, 347 is future,
6.

to learn

33 ༨

.

.

སྦྱོང་བ། Is present, སྦྱང་བ་ Is future,

“to send” གཏོང་བ་ is present, གཏང་བ is future
So, as mentioned above, when we say “tang” for present tense — which people commonly do — it could actually be
seen as its བཏང་ or its future གཏང་་
For a beginner student, it is fine if you think of present and future being the same — but be aware that in terms of
literary Tibetan, this is not true.

Further Examples to Illustrate the Use of Auxiliaries in the Three Times
With &, in most cases ཡིན། is used. The full verb aay is the same for both present and future:
I

to school go (full verb)

(future auxiliary, positive)

I will go to school.
བྲཀ་ཤིས་

གློབ་གྲྭ་ལ་

ཕྱིན་

པ་རེད།

Tashi

to school to go (full verb, past)

(past auxiliary)

Tashi went to school.

Tashi, who is

ཁྱེད་རང་
you

གཞན *, requires a 4/25) 43a"

is the past form of the verb ལགྲོ་བ་

གློབ་གྲྭ་ལ་ འགྲོ་
to school to go (full verb)

བཱ

གི་ཡོད་པས།
(pres aux. with question particle)
