༄༅། ། ལྭ་ཙྭ་བ་རན་ཚན་བཟང་པའ་སྐད་རྒྱུར་སླིབ་གྲའཾ་སློབ་ཚན། །
LRZTP 9 Module 1 — Lesson 5, May-June 2023

And the even better news is that the notions carried by ཡིན་, an, འདུག, etc. remain exactly the same as taught in previous
lessons - even when they are being used as an auxiliary.
So, direct versus inferential knowledge remains the same — just that instead of ཡོད་རེད། & འདུག, for example in present tense it

will be ཟ་གི་ཡོད་རེད། 3114 ཟ་གི་འདུག = (Somebody) eats.
The notion of བདག་གཞན་ remains the same, in the sense that actions completed by oneself are expressed using auxiliaries
related to བདག and vice versa.
And the whole logic becomes even more beautiful and complete when we start talking about actions which happen to us rather

than us performing them. Guess what?! Then you will use the auxiliaries pertaining to གཞན་ to express that absence of
intention.
But one step at the time...

Function and Parts of an Auxiliary
First you need to be completely clear about what an auxiliary 18:
For example:

བྲག་ཤུས
SS

“

¥

Tashi

ee]

ཀང

“.

to/at

cS

འདུག

¥

a dog

is/has.

Tashi has a dog.
In this sentence, འདུག is the main/full (1.6. the only) verb and it expresses the direct experience of the speaker.

Whereas in the sentence below, there is a QQ),

NAINA
SS

mas

ཀྱ་འདུག which is the auxiliary "v for present tense.
8
ལཾ
4
a)
ཀྱ་འདུག

¥

ཅན.

by Tashi

dog

¥

to

¥

meat

x;

ཀང

give

དྲྭ

(present tense auxiliary)

Tashi gives meat to the dog.
In this sentence སྤྲོད་་ (to give) is the main/full verb and ཀྱི་འདུག is the auxiliary (consisting of the connective particle, འབྲེལ་སྒྲ་ - ཀྱི་
+ verb “to be” འདུག). Its function, like that of འདུག, is to express the direct knowledge of the speaker.

As the table above illustrates, the present and future auxiliaries consist of a འབྲེལ་སྒྲ་ and “to have” and “to be” respectively. It is
up to you whether you’d like to think of them in these two aspects or perceive them rather as a whole/unity.
Likewise:

ང་

I

ལ་by

དེབ་ཡག་པོ་གཅིག་
a good book

ཡོད།

have/is

I have a good book.
This sentence does not have a verb, so ཡོད་ is not an auxiliary.
However, the same ཡོད་ is an auxiliary (of present perfect tense) when added to a full verb:

ངས་

I

དེབ་ཡག་པོ་གཅིག་
a good book

ཉོས་
bought

ཡོད།
have

I have bought a good book.
(No worries about the car at this point, this will make sense to you at the end of this lesson!)

Full Verbs
In the spoken language, unlike in literary Tibetan, the full/main verb itself (mostly) has only two forms — past tense and
present/future tense.

1 Remember that from the Tibetan perspective “to have” is not a verb བྱ་ཚིག་ but for an English convention, we call it one here.
*There is a very small number of verbs which have a different form for the imperative. See Lesson 9. And an even smaller
number where present and future are different too — like the ones illustrated here
